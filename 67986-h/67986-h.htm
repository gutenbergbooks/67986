<small>PLAYING HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Trouble!</span> Trouble! Look out! You&#8217;re
knocking over the piano!&#8221; Janet Martin
called this to her little brother William,
who, because of the mischief he so often got
in, was nicknamed &#8220;Trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s piano I knock over?&#8221; asked
Trouble, who was still small enough not to
be expected to talk quite properly. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t was knock over any piano,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! You&#8217;ve knocked it over <i>now</i>!&#8221;
cried Janet, with a wail of despair, as a
small box, which Trouble kicked with his
chubby foot, fell down the steps of the back
porch. &#8220;You knocked over the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Trouble soberly, as he
watched his brother Ted bringing other
boxes to pile on the porch where the children
were playing house that pleasant summer
afternoon. &#8220;Oh, my! I knock over piano,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
went on William, still very grave and serious.
&#8220;Zat&#8217;s funny piano,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only a <i>box</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re pretending it&#8217;s a piano,&#8221;
remarked Janet, as she picked the box up
from the ground where it had tumbled after
Trouble accidentally kicked it. &#8220;You have
to pretend when you&#8217;re playing house,&#8221; she
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Trouble done now?&#8221; asked Ted,
as he put one of his boxes on the porch and
the other down on the ground near the steps.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the garage for our automobile,&#8221; he
said, pointing to the box on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;ll be nice!&#8221; exclaimed Janet.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we were going to have an
auto. This is a lovely playhouse!&#8221; she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet often played house in this
way, setting up a sort of one-floor apartment
on the back porch, with different
rooms marked off by sticks laid on the floor
of the porch. In each of these &#8220;rooms&#8221;
were put different pieces of furniture. Most
of the furniture was just boxes, or perhaps
an old broken chair or two, or even some
sticks and boards. But to the Curlytops the
playhouse was very real. Only Trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
could not &#8220;pretend&#8221; as well as could his
older brother and sister. Ted liked to play
house with Janet, even if he was a boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that other box for?&#8221; asked
Janet of Ted, when she had made Trouble
sit down on a small, broken doll&#8217;s chair in
what was the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; of the playhouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be the cupboard,&#8221; answered
Ted. &#8220;And we can&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Mother Hubbard went to her dog&#8217;s
cupboard!&#8221; sang Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t her dog&#8217;s cupboard, it was her
own,&#8221; corrected Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes it <i>was</i> dog&#8217;s cupboard,&#8221; insisted
Trouble. &#8220;&#8217;Cause she went there to get him
a bone, but it was bare. Does it mean the
bone didn&#8217;t have any clothes on?&#8221; asked
Trouble of his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; laughed Ted. &#8220;Bones
don&#8217;t wear clothes. It means the cupboard
was bare&mdash;it didn&#8217;t have even a bone in it
for the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was <i>dog&#8217;s</i> cupboard all right!&#8221;
still insisted the little boy. &#8220;You goin&#8217; have
Mother Hubbard&#8217;s cupboard here?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this is going to be our own cupboard,&#8221;
answered Ted, as he set up the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
box he had carried out from the barn. &#8220;And
we&#8217;ll have real things to eat to put in our
cupboard, too,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Not <i>really</i>?&#8221; cried Janet, with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really and truly,&#8221; insisted Teddy.
&#8220;Look, mother said I could take these cookies,&#8221;
and he pulled half a dozen or more
from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll have a lovely playhouse!&#8221; exclaimed
Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make believe I&#8217;m the
cook, and you must go to work, Ted, and
come home and I&#8217;ll have your supper ready
and I&#8217;ll dress up as mother does when daddy
comes home to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;Do you know
where I work, Jan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m conductor on an airship!&#8221; laughed
Teddy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up in a tree and make
believe that&#8217;s an airship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is more fun than we ever had before!&#8221;
cried Janet. &#8220;Oh, Trouble, you
mustn&#8217;t go in there!&#8221; she added, as she saw
her small brother picking his way over the
sticks that were laid down in squares to
mark off the different rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not go here?&#8221; questioned Trouble, pausing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
with one foot in one room, and the other
in another apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t go in there!&#8221; insisted
Janet. &#8220;That&#8217;s the parlor and your feet are
all dirty. You can&#8217;t go in the parlor with
dirty shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Trouble. &#8220;Could I
have cookie from pantry?&#8221; he asked, watching
Ted set up the box and put in it some
of the good things from the real kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can have a cookie when I get
Ted&#8217;s dinner,&#8221; agreed Janet. &#8220;Now you
go out and play in the yard, and when you
hear the whistle blow that will mean Daddy
Ted is coming home, and you must come in
and eat with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I eat real&mdash;have some cookie?&#8221;
asked Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll let you eat real,&#8221; laughed
Janet. &#8220;But don&#8217;t knock over the piano
again,&#8221; she begged, as she again set up the
box that Trouble had sent toppling down
the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not knock over no more,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you make believe you&#8217;re a miner
digging for gold,&#8221; suggested Ted, giving his
small brother a shovel and pointing to a soft
place in the dirt of the yard. &#8220;And when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
I go &#8216;Toot! Toot!&#8217; that means it&#8217;s the twelve
o&#8217;clock whistle and you stop work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; then we eat!&#8221; cried Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, then we eat,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;m going to be a conductor in my airship,&#8221;
he added, as he climbed into the branches of
a tree near the back porch. Trouble began
digging with his shovel in the soft dirt, and
Janet arranged the different rooms of the
playhouse to suit her own ideas, placing a
bunch of leaves on the &#8220;piano&#8221; as an ornament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet! Janet! Oh, Jan!&#8221; suddenly cried
Trouble, after a few minutes of digging.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; asked his sister,
as her small brother looked up from his
digging. &#8220;Did you hurt yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I is not goin&#8217; to be miner an&#8217;
dig for gold,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to be then?&#8221; Ted
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I be fisherman diggin&#8217; for worms,&#8221; decided
Trouble. &#8220;&#8217;At&#8217;s most fun &#8217;cause I
got a worm right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, be a fisherman and dig for
worms,&#8221; agreed Janet. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him spoil
anything in the playhouse,&#8221; she called to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Teddy up in the tree. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask
mother something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Ted. &#8220;Are you going
after more cookies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to see if mother will let
me take her little diamond locket,&#8221; answered
Janet. &#8220;I mean the one with the teeny little
diamond in. I want to wear it when I dress
up and make believe I&#8217;m a lady getting my
husband&#8217;s supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; laughed Ted. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t believe mother will let you take her
diamond locket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she will if I promise to be careful
of it,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>She went into the house, while Ted continued
to play that he was a conductor on an
airship, taking up tickets from the make-believe
passengers. Trouble kept on digging
worms, carefully putting them in a tin
can.</p>

<p>Janet found her mother out in the front
yard, talking to Mrs. Jenk, a neighbor, and
both ladies were laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; asked
Janet, before she asked to be allowed to wear
the diamond ornament.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Jenk&#8217;s tame crow,&#8221; answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;He really is so funny! He
ought to be in a show. Look at him!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed to the open window of Mrs.
Jenk&#8217;s house, where, on the sill, was perched
a black crow. This crow had been caught by
Mr. Jenk in the woods some years before.
He had tamed the bird, which was lame from
having been injured in a trap, and now it
could do quite a number of tricks, besides
saying a few words, or what sounded like
words. The lame, tame crow could also
whistle, often fooling Skyrocket, the Curlytops&#8217;
dog.</p>

<p>Just now the crow was marching up and
down on the window sill, going limpity-limp,
for one leg was shorter than the other. Suddenly
Mrs. Jenk tapped on the fence with
a stick, and, at the same time, she snapped
her fingers.</p>

<p>Instantly the lame, tame crow stood on his
good leg, cocked his head to one side and
stuck his short, lame leg out to one side,
standing in this funny position as stiff and
motionless as a stuffed bird. Then, suddenly,
he made several popping sounds like
corks being pulled from bottles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t he funny!&#8221; laughed Janet.
&#8220;He ought to be in a show!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Jenk had an offer from a
theatrical man who wanted to put Jim in
a show,&#8221; said Mrs. Jenk. &#8220;This man said
our crow was quite valuable, but Mr. Jenk
didn&#8217;t want to let him go. He says he is
going to teach Jim more tricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope he does!&#8221; cried Janet. The
crow stood on two legs again, and once more
marched up and down the window sill. &#8220;Do
you think I could make him stand that
funny way and pop?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Jenk.</p>

<p>The little girl tapped on the fence and
snapped her fingers.</p>

<p>Instantly Jim stiffened, cocked his head
on one side, stuck out his lame leg and stood
on the other, stiff and motionless. Then he
went:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop! Pop! Pop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I did it! I did it!&#8221; laughed Janet,
as Mrs. Jenk went in the house. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this time the crow did no tricks. Perhaps
he was tired of showing off. At any
rate he flew into a tree over in the yard
back of the home of the Curlytops. Jim was
allowed to fly about as he pleased, and was
well known in the neighborhood. He always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
flew home at night, though, and slept in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; called Janet, as she saw
Mrs. Martin turning to go in the house.
&#8220;Could I take your little diamond locket?
Not the big one, just the little teeny one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin had two diamond lockets, one
a very expensive one, and the other not so
valuable. This small one had been given
to her by her husband when the Martins did
not have as much money as they had now.
And for this reason Janet&#8217;s mother thought
more of her small ornament than she did
of her more costly one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to wear it playing house on
the back porch,&#8221; Janet went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be very careful of it and bring
it back to me as soon as you have finished
playing?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; promised the little girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be ever so careful, and I won&#8217;t let Trouble
or Ted have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ted would be all right,&#8221; said Mrs.
Martin. &#8220;But Trouble might drop it and
step on it. I&#8217;ll let you take it for a half hour
or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the locket, with its tiny diamond,
from her jewelry box, and gave it into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
eager hands of Janet. The little girl&#8217;s eyes
sparkled like twin diamonds as she clasped
the ornament about her neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now be careful of it!&#8221; cautioned her
mother, as Janet went back to play house
with Ted and Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; the little girl promised.</p>

<p>Ted was getting down out of the tree when
Janet reached the porch, and Trouble was
digging in a new place for worms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were gone a long time,&#8221; said Ted.
&#8220;I blew the whistle three times. I got to
have my dinner,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;&#8217;cause the
ship&#8217;s got to sail to China right away soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, I&#8217;ll get your dinner quick,&#8221;
offered Janet, pretending to be serious. &#8220;I
just stopped a minute to look at the tame
crow,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He stood on one leg for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it for me, too,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he could be in a show if he wanted
to, only Mr. Jenk won&#8217;t sell him,&#8221; added
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we could get up a circus and have
him in one of the acts,&#8221; suggested Ted.
&#8220;Oh, mother let you take the diamond,
didn&#8217;t she?&#8221; he asked, as he saw the sparkle
on Janet&#8217;s neck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Yes, I can wear it while we play house,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll get dinner. Did
you blow the whistle for Trouble to come?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. But he says he&#8217;s a fisherman,
and fishermen only come when a horn blows,
so I got to blow a horn,&#8221; laughed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honk! Honk,&#8221; he went, pretending to
be a horn. Then Trouble dropped his shovel
and hurried to the &#8220;house&#8221; to get some of
the cookies before his brother and sister
might eat them all.</p>

<p>The children sat on some little chairs that
had once been a doll&#8217;s furniture set belonging
to Janet, and they ate bits of cookies off
a box that formed the &#8220;dining-room table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having lots of fun!&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Piles of it!&#8221; agreed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I likes it lots,&#8221; declared Trouble.
&#8220;What you takin&#8217; off ma&#8217;s diamond for?&#8221;
he asked Janet, for she was unclasping the
locket from her neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to wash the dishes,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;and you never wash dishes with a diamond
locket on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see locket!&#8221; begged Trouble, as
Janet was about to lay it on the box that
served as the cupboard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Be very careful of it!&#8221; cautioned Janet.
She let her small brother take the sparkling
ornament in his hand and admire it for a
few moments. Then Janet took it again and
put it on the box. She was preparing to
&#8220;wash the dishes,&#8221; which was only make-believe,
of course; Trouble was again digging
in his hole; Ted was up in the tree,
pretending to be an airship conductor; when
suddenly there sounded a loud crash in front
of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s happened!&#8221; exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go see!&#8221; offered Trouble, dropping his
shovel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an automobile smash-up!&#8221; shouted
Ted. &#8220;I can see it from here!&#8221; and he began
to scramble down from the tree. &#8220;Two cars
are smashed up!&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>The two Curlytops and Trouble hurried
to the front gate, anxious to see what had
happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE MISSING DIAMOND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> or four men, half a dozen boys and
a policeman were running toward the two
automobiles that, as Ted had said, were in
a &#8220;smash-up.&#8221; The accident had happened
directly in front of the home of the Curlytops,
and they were anxious to know if anyone
had been hurt. They also wanted to
know how it had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, that one car is all smashed!&#8221; cried
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re both smashed!&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like when my toy train ran into the
stove!&#8221; said Trouble, trying to wiggle his
way between his brother and sister so that
he might first get out of the front gate and
nearer to the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>Just then Skyrocket, the Curlytops&#8217; dog,
came rushing, barking, out of the house.
He, too, had heard the excitement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Look out, Trouble! Look out!&#8221; cried
Janet, as she saw what was about to happen.
But it was too late. Skyrocket tried to dash
between the legs of little William, but the
opening was not wide enough, and Trouble
stumbled and fell in a heap on the dog.</p>

<p>Dog and boy howled together, though
neither of them was much hurt. At the
same time Janet saw the policeman lift a
man from one of the wrecked cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess they&#8217;ll have to take him to
the hospital!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; agreed Ted, as he stopped to
pick Trouble up, finding that his small
brother was more frightened than hurt.</p>

<p>Then the three Martin children proceeded
on out into the street to look at the accident,
about which had gathered a crowd of men
and boys, with a few girls and women.</p>

<p>And while the policeman is trying to find
out how it all happened, and look after the
two injured men&mdash;for there were two&mdash;this
will be a chance to let my new readers know
a little something about the Curlytops&mdash;who
they were, where they lived, and what they
had done up to this time. I will not take
very long in telling it, as I think you want
to keep on with the story part.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Ted, or Teddy, whose real name was
Theodore, and Janet, or &#8220;Jan,&#8221; as she was
called for short, were the children of Mr.
and Mrs. Richard Martin, who owned a
large store in Cresco, in an eastern state.
Because of their ringlets of golden hair, Ted
and Janet were called Curlytops, and under
that name I have written several books
about them. The first volume is called &#8220;The
Curlytops at Cherry Farm,&#8221; and while
there the children, including small William
Anthony Martin, otherwise known as
&#8220;Trouble,&#8221; had many adventures.</p>

<p>Following that the Curlytops went to Star
Island, they were snowed in, they visited at
Uncle Frank&#8217;s ranch, and spent a vacation
at Silver Lake. Then they helped take care
of some animal pets belonging to Uncle
Toby, and just before the present story I
told of the adventures of Ted, Janet and
Trouble in the book named &#8220;The Curlytops
and Their Playmates.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Curlytops&mdash;and I include Trouble
with them, though his hair did not curl as
did that of Ted and Janet&mdash;were always
playing and having adventures, just as you
have read about them starting to play house
in this book.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>As I have mentioned, Trouble was always
in mischief of some sort or other, and often
it might not be his fault&mdash;it was more of an
accident, as when Skyrocket the dog tried
to run between the legs of the little fellow.</p>

<p>For a time all was forgotten about playing
house. Janet gave no more heed to
being dressed like a lady to get Daddy Ted&#8217;s
supper. Ted forgot all about playing conductor
in the tree airship, and while Trouble
was with his brother and sister looking at
the auto accident, all the worms he had dug
crawled out of the shallow can into which
he had put them, and away they wiggled.</p>

<p>The accident was rather a serious one.
Two cars had come together with a loud
crash right in front of the Curlytops&#8217; house,
and both were badly damaged. The driver
of each one was hurt and Policeman Kelly
had to call the ambulance to take them both
to the hospital.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; asked Ted of
Harry Kent, one of his chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see it,&#8221; Harry answered; &#8220;but
I heard a man say one car tried to turn the
corner and the man in it didn&#8217;t put his hand
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought always to put your hand out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
when you&#8217;re going to turn a corner,&#8221; said
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you ought,&#8221; agreed Harry. &#8220;I
guess he&#8217;ll do it after this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the ambulance!&#8221; cried
Janet, as a loudly clanging bell was heard
down the street. Up dashed the vehicle and
soon the doctor was attending to the two
men, who had been laid on the grass near
the curb.</p>

<p>After putting some bandages on the injured
men the doctor had some bystanders
help him lift them into the ambulance and
away they were taken, leaving the two
smashed cars for the crowd to stare at.</p>

<p>The Curlytops met many of their friends
at the accident, for boys and girls, hearing
of it, came from the near-by houses. And
Ted, Janet and Trouble knew most of the
girls and boys for several blocks around.</p>

<p>The excitement of the accident drove all
thoughts of playing house from the minds
of the Curlytops and they remained out in
front of their house so long, talking with
their playmates, that it was time for Mr.
Martin to come home from the store for supper
before Ted and Janet thought of what
they had been doing. Mrs. Martin had also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
come out to look at the wrecked automobiles,
but had gone inside again, to tell the cook
about the meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Curlytops, did you do this?&#8221;
asked Daddy Martin, with a laugh, as he
stopped in front of his house to watch men
from a garage starting to take away the
wrecked cars. &#8220;I suppose Trouble did the
most of it,&#8221; added Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not mash those autos!&#8221; cried Trouble,
evidently thinking his father was in earnest.
&#8220;They did mash up theirselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a pretty good piece of work they
made of it,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;Anyone
hurt, Curlytops?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two drivers,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>There was a rustling in the tree under
which the children stood talking with their
father, and, looking up, Janet cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jim, Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s flying home,&#8221; added Ted</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you been doing all day,
children?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take
that, Trouble!&#8221; he quickly cried, as the little
boy pulled some papers from the side pocket
of his father&#8217;s coat. &#8220;I need those. I&#8217;ll
have to use them if I go to Mount Major to
open a store for the lumber camp.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Oh, are you going away?&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a while, maybe,&#8221; her father answered,
as he looked to make sure Trouble
had taken none of his papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going?&#8221; asked Ted.
&#8220;Mount Major is where they cut lumber,
isn&#8217;t it, Dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they cut a great deal of lumber
there,&#8221; said Mr. Martin, as he watched the
lame, tame crow of his neighbor fly down
into a tree in Mr. Jenk&#8217;s yard. &#8220;And they
are starting work for the summer now, felling
a lot of trees to get ready to saw up into
lumber this fall. They want me to go up
there and start a store, so the lumbermen
may be able to buy things to eat without
having to travel so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; inquired Ted once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s too early to talk about that
now,&#8221; laughed Mr. Martin. &#8220;But tell me
what you Curlytops did all day. I suppose
you studied your lessons, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lessons? On Saturday!&#8221; cried Janet,
not seeing the funny twinkle in her father&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only joking!&#8221; declared Ted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
this was true. Mr. Martin liked to tease his
children a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what were you doing?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;It looks as though Trouble had been digging
in the garden,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was diggin&#8217; worms for to go fishin&#8217;
with,&#8221; said the little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he fell down when Skyrocket tried
to run between his legs,&#8221; added Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was when we heard the auto crash
and all ran out to see what it was,&#8221; explained
Janet. &#8220;Before that we were playing house,
and Trouble was going to be a miner, and
Ted was a conductor on an airship up in a
tree, and I was&mdash;Oh, I was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet suddenly stopped speaking, clapped
her hand over her mouth and started to run
around to the back porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot all about it!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin, for he
could tell by Janet&#8217;s face that it was something
important. &#8220;What did she forget
about?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin of Ted and
Trouble.</p>

<p>The two boys shook their heads. Their
father followed Janet around to the back
door and the brothers went with him. They
saw Janet eagerly searching about the playhouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
looking on and in boxes and around
the chairs and pieces of wood. Just then
Mrs. Martin came to the back door. She
greeted her husband with a kiss and then,
turning to Janet, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please give me back my diamond locket,
my dear. You have played with it long
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; gasped Janet. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
you&mdash;didn&#8217;t you come out and take it?
Haven&#8217;t you your locket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, Janet, I haven&#8217;t it,&#8221; was the
surprised answer. &#8220;I let you take it and
you said you would bring it back to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I did, and I meant to. I took
it off my neck to wash the dishes after our
play dinner, and Trouble asked me to let
him look at it and&mdash;Oh, Trouble, you have
mother&#8217;s locket, haven&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s right,
I let you take it. What did you do with it?
Where is mother&#8217;s shiny gold and diamond
locket, Trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I no have got it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I let you take it!&#8221; insisted Janet.
&#8220;You wanted to hold it in your hand because
it sparkled so nice, and I let you.
Didn&#8217;t you have the locket, Trouble?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Yes, I did have,&#8221; gravely admitted the
small boy. &#8220;An&#8217; it was pretty. It shined
like the sun. But I gived it back to you,
Jan. You put it on the box in the play
kitchen. Don&#8217;t you &#8217;member? I gived it
back to you out of mine own hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet gave a start and looked at the box.
She remembered now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, Trouble. You did
give it back to me after I let you take it,&#8221;
she said slowly. &#8220;You gave it back to me
and I put it on the box so I wouldn&#8217;t catch
anything in the chain when I unset the play
table and washed the dishes. Ted, you didn&#8217;t
take the locket, did you?&#8221; she asked, turning
to her older brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But I saw you put
it on the box. It ought to be there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; and there were tears in
Janet&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; she half-sobbed,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t find your lovely diamond
locket! I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin looked anxious, for the locket
was one she prized very highly. She did not
want to lose it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it may have been knocked off
the box when you all ran out to see the auto
accident,&#8221; suggested Mr. Martin. &#8220;Be careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
where you step, and we&#8217;ll look around
the porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was done, but with all the searching
no diamond locket was found. Mrs. Martin
helped, and after all the boxes, boards and
toy furniture had been cleared from the rear
porch the place was carefully swept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said Mr. Martin,
looking at his wife. &#8220;I shall have to
buy you another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any other!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Martin, with tears in her eyes. &#8220;I want my
own dear little diamond locket! Oh, Janet,
why did you lose it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; and Janet began
to sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know you didn&#8217;t, child,&#8221; said her
mother, patting the curly head. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
have given in to you and let you take it. Are
you sure Trouble didn&#8217;t drop it somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I no take it!&#8221; stoutly cried William. &#8220;I
did hab locket but I gived it back to Jan and
she losted it. I not lost <i>everything</i>!&#8221; and
he was quite indignant about it, for Trouble
knew that he had no very good reputation
about losing things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Trouble gave it back to me,&#8221; declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Janet. &#8220;And I put it on the box.
Maybe I picked it up again and was going
to put it on my neck when the auto crash
happened. I don&#8217;t exactly remember what
I did with it. Oh, dear, I wish I could
find it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; consoled Mrs. Martin.
&#8220;If it&#8217;s gone it can&#8217;t be helped. We&#8217;ll look
around the yard to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before the next day came something
else happened.</p>

<p>It was after supper in the home of the
Curlytops. They had been talking over the
events of the day, including the tricks of
Jim, the black crow, the loss of the locket,
and the auto crash, when the telephone bell
jingled. Mr. Martin answered, but at almost
the first words he heard over the wire he
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? My store on fire? I&#8217;ll be
right down!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE LOST CROW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> can imagine better than I can tell
you how much excitement there was in the
home of the Curlytops when Mr. Martin
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;My store is on fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was so excited that she
dropped one of Trouble&#8217;s stockings she was
darning. Inside was a round wooden stocking-darner
that fell to the floor with a crash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy!&#8221; cried Jan, in alarm. It
seemed a terrible thing to know that her
father&#8217;s store was burning.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Martin, after she had dropped
the stocking, she sat looking at her husband,
not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Ted cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Send for the fire engines!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re already there!&#8221; said Mr. Martin,
as he ran from the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; shouted Ted, following
his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t go! Stay here!&#8221; commanded
his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a little fire engine!&#8221; was what
Trouble said. He did not understand that
a big engine, pumping much water, was
needed to put out a large fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mother, I just got to go!&#8221;
pleaded Ted, as he reached the door, out of
which his father had hurried. &#8220;I want to
help daddy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was too dazed and surprised
to say again that Teddy should not go. She
knew that he wanted to help, and he also
wanted to see a fire. Any boy would.</p>

<p>It was early, hardly dark yet, and Mr.
Martin&#8217;s store was not far away. Ted had
often gone down there alone in the evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; Ted&#8217;s mother called to him,
as he ran out of the front door and down the
street after his father. There were other
men and boys on the sidewalk now, all running
toward the scene of the fire. There
were even some women and a few girls. But
Jan remained at home with her mother and
Trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin heard pattering behind him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the sound of little feet that he knew well.
Turning, he saw Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go back,&#8221; warned the boy&#8217;s
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, I want to come! I&#8217;ll help!&#8221;
promised the Curlytop lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you can&#8217;t help very much,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin. &#8220;But as long as you have
come this far, I&#8217;ll have to take you. Give
me your hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>With his father&#8217;s fingers clasping his, Ted
found it much easier to run along. They
were nearing the store and now could hear
the tooting and clanging of the engines and
the shouts of men and boys, mingled with
the barking of dogs. Mr. Martin, in his excitement,
was running so fast that Ted could
hardly keen up, but the Curlytop boy managed
to skip along, never letting go his
father&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they turned a corner, Mr.
Martin and Ted saw the crowd in the street.
They saw one engine pumping water, and
another, with smoke pouring from the stack,
was getting ready to work. There was also
a cloud of smoke coming from an outside
shed of Mr. Martin&#8217;s store.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fire&#8217;s in the shed, Ted!&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the boy&#8217;s father, in relief. &#8220;I guess it
won&#8217;t amount to very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; Ted answered. It
was about all he could say, for he was quite
out of breath from having run so fast with
his father.</p>

<p>Just then there was a sudden banging and
popping noise, and a shower of sparks shot
out from the shed attached to the store.
Then came some balls of colored fire and
next a skyrocket sailed out over the fire
engines and over the heads of the crowd,
bursting with a pop up in the air. Then
more beautifully colored sparks, stars, and
balls of fire were scattered about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what is it, Daddy? Fourth of July?&#8221;
cried Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about what it is,&#8221; answered
Mr. Martin. &#8220;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was drowned in another burst
of sparks from the shed, followed by another
skyrocket and then some more loud poppings.
Out of the shed rushed a fireman,
crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of Roman candles and skyrockets
going off in there! It isn&#8217;t a fire
at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke another skyrocket whizzed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
over his head and the crowd began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourth of July! Fourth of July!&#8221;
yelled some boys, capering about. They
yelled again as many colored balls from
some Roman candles shot into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re celebrating Independence Day a
little out of season, aren&#8217;t you, Mr. Martin?&#8221;
asked a man in the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;It begins to look that way,&#8221; laughed Mr.
Martin. &#8220;I see what happened. I had some
fireworks stored in the shed. In some way
the box must have caught fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another rocket shot up, then some fire-crackers
exploded and next came a glare of
red fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray! Hurray!&#8221; shouted the boys in
the crowd, and Ted could not help joining
in, for this was the jolliest fire he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>With the burst of red fire the display
came to an end, the glare died away, there
was no longer any popping from the fire-crackers,
and all that could be seen was a lot
of smoke pouring from the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the worst is over,&#8221; said the fire
chief, as he told the fireman, who had run
from the shed when the explosions began, to
put on a smoke-helmet and go back again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to wet what sparks he might find. Other
firemen, also wearing smoke-helmets, went
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire&#8217;s out, Chief!&#8221; the men reported a
little later. &#8220;Not much damage done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; remarked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s nothing left of that box of
fireworks,&#8221; said another fireman, with a
grin, as he took off his smoke-helmet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t suppose there would be,&#8221;
replied the store owner. &#8220;I never should
have left it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who set off the skyrockets, Daddy?&#8221;
asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;They set themselves off after the box
caught fire,&#8221; his father told him. &#8220;But how
the box caught I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; And the
cause of the little fire was never found out.</p>

<p>Really it was not much of a fire, for the
only things that burned were the fireworks
and the box in which they had been stored.
But there was a great deal of smoke, as Ted
discovered when he and his father went into
the store a little later. Some firemen and
police officers also went in, but the crowd
was kept out. Ted felt proud that he could
get in ahead of the other boys. But then, of
course, it was his father&#8217;s store.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;Nothing at all burned up here,&#8221; said the
fire chief, looking around. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t even
scorch the back wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you and your men got
here so quickly with the engines,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Martin. &#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of smoke, though,&#8221; said a
policeman. &#8220;Must have come from that
window into the shed. It was partly open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll open some windows and let the
smoke out,&#8221; said a fireman. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have
more damage by smoke than you will by fire
or water, Mr. Martin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, smoke isn&#8217;t any too good for groceries,&#8221;
said Ted&#8217;s father. &#8220;About the only
things I know of that are made better by
smoke are hams and herring. However,
this might have been much worse. Who
turned in the alarm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake,&#8221; said the chief, naming a
man Mr. Martin knew. &#8220;He was passing
and saw smoke coming from the shed door.
Then he telephoned to fire headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must thank him,&#8221; said Mr. Martin.
&#8220;If the fire hadn&#8217;t been discovered in time,
my whole store might have burned. I&#8217;ll just
let my wife know the danger is past,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
added, going to the telephone in the store
office near the big safe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin soon heard the good news
that what little fire there had been was put
out. There was nothing more to be done,
and a policeman said he would remain on
guard in the store while the windows and
doors were kept open to let the smoke blow
out during the night.</p>

<p>Then Ted and his father walked back
home. The engines had gone back to their
quarters, the dogs had stopped barking, and
the crowd had vanished, for there was nothing
more to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother! It was just like Fourth of
July!&#8221; cried Teddy as he entered the house.
&#8220;Skyrockets, an&#8217; Roman candles an&#8217; everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d been there!&#8221; exclaimed Janet.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the store burn at all, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only the box of fireworks in the
shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there will be some loss, won&#8217;t
there?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, some,&#8221; her husband answered.
&#8220;A few things will have to be thrown away,
because food does not taste good after it has
been smoked, and some other things may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
blackened. But the insurance company will
pay me. And now, Curlytops, off to bed
with you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting late.
Trouble is in Dreamland long ago, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I tucked him in,&#8221; said his mother.
And when Ted and Janet had gone up to
bed their mother sighed a little and said:
&#8220;My, but this has been an exciting day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t find your diamond locket, I
suppose?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And I&#8217;m afraid I never shall,&#8221;
answered his wife. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have
allowed Janet to take it, but she begged so
hard and they were having such fun playing
house that I gave in to her. I thought the
necklace would be safe on the porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d imagine it would,&#8221; agreed
her husband. &#8220;I rather think Trouble had
a hand in the loss of your diamond,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;He must have picked it up because
it was bright and shiny, and then have
dropped it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think Trouble isn&#8217;t to blame this
time,&#8221; replied Mrs. Martin. &#8220;He does mischief
enough, but this time he seems to know
what he is talking about. He had the locket
in his hand, but gave it back to Janet. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
she isn&#8217;t sure what happened to it after the
auto crash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s gone, at any rate, and there&#8217;s
no use worrying about it,&#8221; said Mr. Martin.
&#8220;Now I must think what I am going to do
to-morrow. I can&#8217;t open the store until
after the insurance people have figured out
how much they will pay me for my loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will this spoil your plans?&#8221; asked his
wife. &#8220;I mean can you get off to Mount
Major to start the store for the lumber
camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; answered the father of
the Curlytops. &#8220;In fact I think this little
fire will make it easier. I can&#8217;t do any business
here because my store will be closed
until the loss is settled. And while I&#8217;m
waiting for that I can go to Mount Major.
I&#8217;ll leave somebody in charge. How would
you like to go along?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean all of us?&#8221; she questioned.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t very well go and leave the children
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I mean for all of us to go,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;I shall have to remain several
weeks to get the lumber-camp store well
started, and as this is practically the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of the summer vacation in the school
the children can just as well go as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could we stay in the woods?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a bungalow there&mdash;a very good
one, I believe. I intended to live in it myself,
but there is room for us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The children will be delighted!&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;To think of spending
a summer in the woods!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the Curlytops will like the woods
all right, I think,&#8221; chuckled Mr. Martin.
&#8220;And so will Trouble. We&#8217;ll tell them about
it in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin made an early trip to his
store, to look over the damage by daylight.
When he came back the Curlytops and
Trouble were having their breakfasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is store all burned?&#8221; asked Trouble,
pausing in his eating of oatmeal and milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not quite all burned,&#8221; laughed
his father. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come down
with your fire engine and help put the blaze
out, Trouble?&#8221; he asked, teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&mdash;she now&mdash;she wouldn&#8217;t let
me,&#8221; stammered the little fellow, getting
ready to take a spoonful of oatmeal and
milk. But somehow or other, he missed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
his aim and part of the spoon&#8217;s contents
spilled on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look what you did!&#8221; cried Janet.
&#8220;Look, Trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble looked. He often soiled the tablecloth
and more than once he had been
scolded for it, as his mother did not want
him to fall into careless table manners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you did it!&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;yep&mdash;I did spill some <i>milk</i>,&#8221; admitted
Trouble. &#8220;But&mdash;but you&mdash;you&mdash;now&mdash;you
now&mdash;<i>lost mother&#8217;s diamond
locket</i>!&#8221; accused the little fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Trouble! It couldn&#8217;t be
helped,&#8221; said his father, as he took up the
spilled milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,
Mother, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, my dear!&#8221; soothed Mrs.
Martin. &#8220;We may find the locket yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there were tears in the little girl&#8217;s
eyes, and Ted, too, felt a bit sad, for he
thought that in moving about the boxes in
the playhouse he might have knocked the
locket down into some hole or crack where
it could never be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; went on Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Martin. &#8220;Tell them the good news, Daddy,
and cheer them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good news?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it about the fire?&#8221; asked Janet.
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it your place after all, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there was a fire in my store all
right,&#8221; her father told her. &#8220;But it didn&#8217;t
really amount to much. However, the fire
will not prevent my going to the Mount
Major lumber camp, to start a supply store
there for the men. And your mother and I
have decided that we shall all go there and
spend the summer vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to Mount Major?&#8221; cried Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; his father said.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the woods?&#8221; exclaimed Janet, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun!&#8221; cried the Curlytops together,
and Trouble, finishing his oatmeal,
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I likes to have fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know that!&#8221; chuckled Ted.</p>

<p>And then followed such a lot of talk and
so much laughter over the happy days to
come that it is a wonder anyone ate any
breakfast. And when the meal was nearly
over there came a ring at the door, and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Jenk, the neighbor in the adjoining house,
came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Martin,&#8221; said
Mr. Jenk, &#8220;especially after your fire
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not disturbing us,&#8221; said Mr.
Martin pleasantly. &#8220;As for the fire, it
didn&#8217;t amount to as much as we feared. It
was really only some fireworks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I came over for,&#8221; said Mr. Jenk,
as he took his seat in a chair, &#8220;is to ask you
if you have seen Jim this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tame crow?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jim,&#8221; went on Mr. Jenk. &#8220;My
crow is missing, and I wouldn&#8217;t lose him for
a good deal. He&#8217;s worth more than a hundred
dollars and he gets cuter and smarter
every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is Jim gone?&#8221; exclaimed Ted. &#8220;How
did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered
Mr. Jenk. &#8220;He came in last night, as he
always does, just before dark, and he went
to sleep on his perch in the kitchen. But
this morning he was gone. I know he used
to come over here quite often, and I thought
perhaps some of you might have seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We saw him yesterday afternoon,&#8221; replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Janet, and Ted nodded his head at
this. &#8220;But we haven&#8217;t seen him this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Mr. Jenk, as he arose
to leave. &#8220;I&#8217;d give a good deal to get my
crow back. That theater man said he was
one of the best trick birds he&#8217;d ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked so funny when he stood on one
leg and stuck the other out,&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was one of the first tricks I
taught him,&#8221; remarked Mr. Jenk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he could make a noise like popping
corks as real as anything!&#8221; said Teddy.
&#8220;Come on, Janet,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
look for Jim. Maybe he&#8217;s out in a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the children were about to leave the
table, Mrs. Martin suddenly raised her hand
for silence and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen sounded a loud &#8220;pop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Jim now!&#8221; cried Ted, making
a rush for the kitchen.</p>

<small>TROUBLE&#8217;S SQUIRREL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted Martin</span> was not alone in his rush for
the kitchen. He was followed by Janet and
Trouble. Only Trouble did not get very far.
For Skyrocket, the dog, who had been asleep
in a corner, roused up suddenly at the sound
of Ted&#8217;s hurrying steps and managed to get
in Trouble&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>The result was that Trouble fell down.
But, as he was a fat, chubby little chap, a
fall did not harm him much. Only this time
he stepped on Skyrocket&#8217;s paw and the dog
howled.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! More excitement!&#8221; laughed Mother
Martin, as she followed Ted and Janet, first
stopping to pick up Trouble and make sure
he wasn&#8217;t hurt. Mr. Martin and Neighbor
Jenk followed more slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jim?&#8221; asked Ted of Lucy, the
colored cook.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;Whar am who, chile?&#8221; asked Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Jim, Mr. Jenk&#8217;s tame crow?&#8221;
repeated Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard him out here, making a noise
like pulling a cork from a bottle,&#8221; added
Janet. &#8220;Where did he go, Lucy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; mean a Jim crow was out heah
makin&#8217; believe pull corks from a bottle?&#8221;
asked the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s one of his tricks,&#8221; explained
Mr. Jenk, though as he looked around the
kitchen and saw no glistening black bird he
began to wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat wasn&#8217;t no crow pullin&#8217; a cork!&#8221; said
Lucy, with a laugh that shook her fat sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it then?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was me! Ah done pulled a cork from
de vinegah bottle,&#8221; explained Lucy, and
she showed them a bottle of vinegar she had
just opened. Pulling the cork had caused
a popping sound like that made by Jim the
pet crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; said Mr. Jenk.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sah. Ah ain&#8217;t seen no crow,&#8221; answered
Lucy. &#8220;Dat bird suah am too
smart,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;He done hab de evil
eye, he suah hab!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say such things, Lucy,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
chided Mrs. Martin. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any such
thing as an evil eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mebby dey ain&#8217;t,&#8221; admitted the
cook. &#8220;But ef dey <i>was</i> a evil eye, dat Jim
crow suah would hab it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s smart, all right,&#8221; admitted Mr.
Jenk. &#8220;Well, as long as my crow isn&#8217;t here
I may as well go back and look elsewhere
for him. I hope I find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do we,&#8221; echoed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you see anything of him, either catch
him or let me know,&#8221; begged the owner of
Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give a reward of five dollars for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to earn all that money,&#8221; sighed
Ted, for he had visions of what he could buy
with five dollars. &#8220;But we&#8217;re going away
to Mount Major, to live in a lumber camp,
and I guess we won&#8217;t see Jim up there, Mr.
Jenk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose you will,&#8221; admitted
the neighbor, with a sigh. &#8220;But if you do
see him let me know. Jim was a valuable
crow! So you are going to Mount Major,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the Curlytops&#8217; father, and
told about the proposed trip.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenk went back home, and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Curlytops talked of their coming outing in
the woods. Trouble found the pail and
shovel with which he had been playing the
day before and started for the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked his
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go dig more worms,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I
got to have a lot of worms to fish with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going fishing?&#8221; Ted
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fish in lake up by daddy&#8217;s lumber
camp,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Daddy, he say
there&#8217;s lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin, in
answer to looks from Ted and Janet.
&#8220;There is also a river, I believe, down which
logs are floated. But you&#8217;ll see all this when
we go to Mount Major.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are we going?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221; Janet wanted to know. &#8220;In
the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we are going by auto the end of
this week,&#8221; answered Mrs. Martin, for after
the search for the crow Mr. Martin had gone
back to his store to meet the fire insurance
agents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun we&#8217;ll have!&#8221; joyously
cried Janet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;The best times we ever knew!&#8221; agreed
her Curlytop brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go look for Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow,&#8221; proposed
Janet, and out they ran to the fields
and a little patch of woods not far from
their home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you go?&#8221; asked Trouble, as he
looked up from his digging to watch his
brother and sister. &#8220;I come,&#8221; he added, not
bothering to put in all the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to look for Jim,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find him!&#8221; declared Trouble, as if it
were easy to locate a missing crow. Though
Jim was lame in his legs, and could only
hobble about, his wings were as strong as
ever and he could fly many miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll find him&mdash;not!&#8221; laughed
Ted. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find him as we found mother&#8217;s
missing diamond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk about that!&#8221; pleaded
Janet, who felt very sad over the lost locket.</p>

<p>The search for the tame crow was no more
successful than had been the one for the
diamond locket. The children looked
through the fields and in the little patch of
woods, calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim! Jim! Jim!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there came no &#8220;Caw! Caw!&#8221; in answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
nor did the Curlytops hear the sound
of popping corks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow,&#8221;
said Ted, after they had tramped about for
some time with no success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he flew off to go in some show,&#8221;
suggested Janet, with a laugh. &#8220;He likes
to do his tricks and have us watch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no telling where he is,&#8221; decided
Ted. &#8220;I guess we may as well go back home.
If we&#8217;re going to camp out in the woods I
have lots of things I want to take along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; decided Janet. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know which of my dolls to take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take &#8217;em all,&#8221; suggested Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodore Martin! As if I could take a
<i>dozen</i> dolls!&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen? Have you a dozen dolls?&#8221;
asked her brother, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course I have! And I know some girls
that have &#8217;most two dozen,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Ted. &#8220;Two dozen
dolls! That&#8217;s terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t any such thing!&#8221; declared
Janet. &#8220;How many marbles have you, Ted
Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess maybe I have a hundred.
But marbles are different, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;How many <i>tops</i> have you, Ted Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe, now, about ten or eleven.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many <i>boats</i> have you, Ted Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about nine, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t talk to me about a dozen
<i>dolls</i>!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;You boys are just as
bad as we girls that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we are,&#8221; replied Ted, with a
laugh. &#8220;Hello, where&#8217;s Trouble?&#8221; he asked
suddenly, looking around and not seeing his
small brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was here a moment ago,&#8221; said Janet,
and her voice grew a little anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he was,&#8221; said Ted. &#8220;But he
isn&#8217;t here now. Oh, Trouble!&#8221; he called
loudly.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s lost,&#8221; suggested Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be lost very long or very far,&#8221;
Ted assured her. &#8220;For he was right here
not more than two minutes ago and he
couldn&#8217;t go far in that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call again,&#8221; suggested Janet, and Ted
raised his voice in a loud shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble! William! Trouble!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Thus Ted called, but as he and his sister
listened there was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have wandered off somewhere
when we didn&#8217;t notice,&#8221; suggested Janet.
&#8220;We&#8217;d better hurry back home and get
mother and Skyrocket. Skyrocket can smell
which way Trouble went and find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we&#8217;d better do that,&#8221; agreed
Ted. &#8220;I never saw such a boy as he is for
doing things!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as Ted and Janet were about to hurry
home and tell their mother the news, they
heard a noise in the underbrush at the edge
of the woods. The figure of a boy was dimly
seen, and Janet cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the boy came out of the bushes
it was not Trouble. It was Henry Simpson,
a playmate of Trouble&#8217;s, though somewhat
older.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Henry, have you seen Trouble?&#8221;
asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him,&#8221; said Henry, who was
not much of a talker. You had to ask a
separate question for everything you wanted
Henry to tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw Trouble! Where is he?&#8221; cried
Janet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Over there,&#8221; and Henry pointed to a
little gully in the woods where, during the
spring rains, a stream flowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing there?&#8221; asked Janet,
while Ted started on a run for the place
pointed out by Henry.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s chasin&#8217; a squirrel,&#8221; added the other
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chasing a squirrel?&#8221; cried Janet.
&#8220;Why, he never can catch a squirrel, and
he oughtn&#8217;t to try. He might get hurt.
Why didn&#8217;t you tell him he couldn&#8217;t catch
a squirrel, Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did tell him,&#8221; and Henry grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked Janet, as she
followed Ted across the path toward the
gully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me to go home an&#8217; not bother
him, &#8217;cause he was goin&#8217; to catch a squirrel
an&#8217; have the squirrel find the lost crow,&#8221;
said Henry. This was quite a long sentence
for him, and having gotten it out he turned
around and walked off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; was all Henry answered.</p>

<p>And home he went.</p>

<p>But Ted and Janet hurried on to the little
gully, or valley, in the woods. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
water flowing in it now and the place was
quite dry. As the Curlytops reached the
edge of it, they heard, down below them,
some one pushing through the dried bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble! Trouble!&#8221; cried Ted. &#8220;Are
you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I here,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
scare my squirrel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your squirrel!&#8221; exclaimed Janet.
&#8220;Have you caught one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get him pretty soon,&#8221; Trouble called
back. &#8220;I almost got him twice, but he
skips!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Squirrels are great skippers,&#8221; laughed
Ted.</p>

<p>They went down a little farther into the
gully and there saw Trouble. He was walking
slowly along, holding out his hand in
which he held a nut. And not far from him,
skipping from limb to limb of a tree, was
a large gray squirrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you trying to catch that squirrel,
Trouble?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I want feed him
an&#8217; make him show me where Jim crow is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go down there and get
Trouble,&#8221; Janet advised her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;And maybe you might see Jim,&#8221; added
the little Curlytop girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look,&#8221; offered Ted. &#8220;Though if
there was a crow here I guess he&#8217;d be cawing.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, there was no sight of the glistening
black bird, and Ted made his way
down the side of the gully. Trouble was on
the very bottom, where the stream ran whenever
there was any water, but the course was
now dry. And because he was down in the
gully, Trouble had not heard his brother
and sister calling to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, Trouble! Let the squirrel
go!&#8221; called Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give him this nut!&#8221; insisted the little
fellow. &#8220;He is a good squirrel an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Trouble did not finish that sentence.</p>

<p>The next moment, to the surprise of Ted
and Janet, their little brother fell down and
vanished from sight.</p>

<small>OFF TO MOUNT MAJOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Did</span> you see that, Ted? Did you see
where Trouble went?&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him fall, but I don&#8217;t know
where he went,&#8221; Ted answered. &#8220;I guess
he&#8217;s down in a hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, maybe there&#8217;s water in it and he&#8217;ll
drown!&#8221; went on Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any water here now,&#8221; said
Ted.</p>

<p>And it was a good thing the gully had
gone dry, for Trouble had fallen into a hole
that was filled with deep water when the
stream was rushing through the gully. But,
as Ted remarked, it was now dry.</p>

<p>For a moment after his tumble Trouble
uttered no sound. And then he yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come an&#8217; get me! Come an&#8217; get me out,
Ted!&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;YES, I HERE,&#8221; WAS THE REPLY. &#8220;DON&#8217;T SCARE<br /> MY SQUIRREL!&#8221;<br />

&#8220;The Curlytops in the Woods.&#8221; <span class="gap">    Page <a href="#Page_50">50</a></span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; answered the older boy.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Trouble! I&#8217;m coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time Janet reached the edge of
the leaf-filled hole into which Trouble had
fallen, Teddy had pulled out his little
brother. Trouble was not much hurt, being
only bruised, but he was covered with leaves
and dirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, William, you&#8217;re all right,&#8221;
soothed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry!&#8221; begged Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take
you to the store and buy you a lollypop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble rubbed his tears away, but in
doing so wiped a lot of dirt from his hands
all over his face so that he was quite a sad
looking sight. However, Janet cleaned him
up as best she could with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re as good as ever,&#8221; laughed
Ted, as he picked off the dead leaves clinging
to his small brother. &#8220;What were you
doing down there, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to get squirrel an&#8217; have him
show me where crow is,&#8221; explained Trouble.</p>

<p>Of course he didn&#8217;t get near the squirrel,
and, even if he had given the big-tailed creature
the nut, the squirrel would not have
eaten it, as it was wormy and had no kernel
in it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;But maybe to-morrow I find another nut
an&#8217; I give that to squirrel an&#8217; he find Jim
crow,&#8221; said Trouble, as he walked home with
Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early for this year&#8217;s nuts,&#8221; said
Ted. &#8220;Anyhow, we have to pack up our
things to go to Mount Major.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I go to woods!&#8221; laughed
Trouble. &#8220;An&#8217; I take my fire engine an&#8217;
squirt on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached home and told their mother
about the little adventure. She warned
Trouble he mustn&#8217;t do such a thing again
as wandering off by himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, I won&#8217;t!&#8221; Trouble promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he doesn&#8217;t do that he&#8217;ll do something
else just as troublesome,&#8221; said Janet,
with a sigh. And Trouble did.</p>

<p>These were busy days in the home of the
Curlytops. Mr. Martin had much to do to
get matters straightened out about his
smoke-harmed store, and he had also to get
ready to go to the lumber camp in the woods
to start the supply store there. Mrs. Martin
must pack the things that were to be taken
for a long vacation stay&mdash;she must see to
the clothing for herself and the three children.
The food supplies Mr. Martin would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
look after, as he had to ship up several cars
of groceries to stock the lumber supply
store.</p>

<p>Lucy, the colored cook, was to be taken
along. Once, though, after they had talked
over the joys of camping in the woods, Lucy
came in where Mr. and Mrs. Martin were
sitting, after the children had gone to bed,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, ma&#8217;am, Mrs. Martin, Ah doan
t&#8217;ink Ah&#8217;d bettah go off to de woods wif yo&#8217;
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Lucy?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin, in
surprise. &#8220;I have been counting on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yais, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; went on Lucy. &#8220;But, all
de same, Mrs. Martin, Ah&#8217;s kinder skairt ob
dem jinkses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jinkses! What do you mean?&#8221; asked
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Teddy he done tole me dat de
woods am filled an&#8217; runnin&#8217; ober wif jinkses.
Dey&#8217;s animiles wif curtain tassles on der
ears. Ah doan t&#8217;ink Ah&#8217;d laik &#8217;em much,
Mrs. Martin, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; laughed Mr. Martin. &#8220;Teddy
must have been talking about the lynx,
or bobcat. They do have tassels, or tufts, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
hair on their ears, but they won&#8217;t hurt you,
Lucy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Won&#8217;t dey, Mistah Martin?&#8221; she
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Lucy. Ted shouldn&#8217;t have
spoken of the bobcats in the woods. I don&#8217;t
believe we&#8217;ll see one. But if you should,
Lucy, the lynx would run as soon as it saw
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! He wouldn&#8217;t done run any faster
dan Ah would!&#8221; chuckled the cook. &#8220;All
right. Den Ah guess Ah goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>This much settled, there were other matters
to be looked after before the trip to
Mount Major could be started. As Mr. Martin
had thought, the settlement of his fire
loss by the insurance company would take
some time. During that time his store would
be in charge of a trusted man whose name
was Henderson, and he could thus well
afford to go to the lumber camp.</p>

<p>The Curlytops and Trouble were so excited
over the prospect of fun in the lumber
camp that nothing they played around their
home now, and no sports that they took
part in with their playmates, seemed to satisfy
them. They were always thinking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
what they would do at Mount Major, and
planning picnics and excursions there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to set a trap and see if I can&#8217;t
catch a lynx,&#8221; declared Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t scare Lucy any more, no
matter what you do,&#8221; begged his mother.
&#8220;First I know, she&#8217;ll leave and then we&#8217;ll
have no cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; promised Ted.</p>

<p>Janet had packed her dolls, Teddy his
toys, and Trouble had filled a box with odds
and ends of things he wanted to take to the
woods. But afterward Mrs. Martin went
over all the children&#8217;s boxes and took out a
great many things without telling them
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never miss them,&#8221; she said to
her husband. &#8220;But if I let them take all
they wanted there would be no room for anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they have queer ideas,&#8221; he agreed.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you found your diamond
locket?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; his wife replied, with a sigh. &#8220;I
have given it up. I don&#8217;t say much about
it, for I don&#8217;t want Janet to feel too bad
about losing it. As I should never have let
her take it, it is as much my fault as hers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The trip to Mount Major was to be made,
as I have told you, in Mr. Martin&#8217;s large
automobile. In this would also be carried
the baggage and some food and supplies that
would last the party until the things sent by
express had arrived from Cresco.</p>

<p>It was a long day&#8217;s travel by automobile
from Cresco to Mount Major, and so Mr.
Martin planned to get an early morning
start on the day that was set for the trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have an early breakfast here,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin. &#8220;We will lunch on the
road. And if we have luck we&#8217;ll have supper
in our bungalow in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I just know we&#8217;ll have the loveliest
fun!&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; agreed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; maybe I find Jim crow,&#8221; said
Trouble.</p>

<p>So far no trace had been found of the
missing lame bird pet of Mr. Jenk. Jim
seemed to have disappeared. Once or twice
he had flown away, to be gone perhaps a day
or so, but he had never remained away as
long as this before, his owner declared.</p>

<p>The Curlytops and other children of the
neighborhood had searched through the
near-by woods and fields for Jim, but had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
not heard his harsh cawing cry nor had they
heard him &#8220;pull corks.&#8221; And of course no
one had seen him stand on one leg, with the
other stuck stiffly out and his head, with his
sharp, beady eyes, thrust to one side.</p>

<p>Jim was not to be found, and Mr. Jenk
felt sorry to lose the crow. He even published
a notice in the Cresco paper about
Jim, offering now a reward of ten dollars
for the return of his pet.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I find the crow I&#8217;ll give you half the
reward,&#8221; promised Ted to his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I find him I&#8217;ll give you half,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;If I get the five dollars I&#8217;ll
buy me a new doll carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll get roller skates, a steam engine,
a foot ball, some ice skates and a baseball
bat,&#8221; decided Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; laughed his father, &#8220;you must
think the five dollars are going to be rubber
ones that will stretch out enough to buy a
whole store full of toys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can get something, anyhow!&#8221;
declared Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;First find the crow,&#8221; his father told him.</p>

<p>Teddy and Janet made up their minds
they would spend all the remainder of the
time before leaving for Mount Major looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
for Jim. This they did, but without
result. Jim remained lost.</p>

<p>Then came the glad day on which they
were to start. As much as possible had
been packed into the automobile which was
roomy. And then in piled Mr. and Mrs.
Martin, taking Trouble on the front seat
with them, while Ted, Janet and Lucy rode
on the rear seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of you, Lucy, if any bobcats
come after you,&#8221; promised Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Har! Har!&#8221; laughed fat Lucy. &#8220;Ah
ain&#8217;t skairt ob no bobcats no mo&#8217;. Yo&#8217; papa
done told me &#8217;bout &#8217;em! Ah ain&#8217;t skairt!
Har! Har!&#8221;</p>

<p>Off they started, the Curlytops and
Trouble waving their hands to their playmates
who gathered to bid them good-bye
and wish them a happy summer in the
woods.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin drove around past his store,
for he wanted to leave a last word with Mr.
Henderson, who was in charge, and the children
could see where carpenters were at
work repairing the burned shed, for there
had been some slight damage there, it was
later discovered.</p>

<p>On through the town, out into the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
country, rolled the automobile, with
Ted and Janet now and then breaking out
into short snatches of song to show how
happy they were.</p>

<p>They stopped for lunch along a beautiful
road that led through the woods, and after
eating they walked around to &#8220;stretch their
legs,&#8221; as Mr. Martin called it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must not delay too long,&#8221; said
daddy, after a while. &#8220;We have a long way
yet to go, and I don&#8217;t want to arrive after
dark. Better pile in, Curlytops!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the automobile was filled. Mr.
Martin started the motor and let in the
clutch. But something was wrong. The car
moved a little way and then came to a stop
with a jerk. The engine stalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; her husband answered.
&#8220;Maybe I didn&#8217;t give her enough gas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he started off, but this time
there was a sudden stop, followed by a
crashing, splintering sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re pulling a tree down behind
us!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;Stop, Daddy!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>THE HAY WAGON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daddy Martin</span> put on the brakes very
quickly and pushed on the pedal that threw
out the clutch. With a squeak of the brake
bands the car came to a stop. The cracking,
splintering sound stopped, and the father
of the Curlytops quickly leaped from the
automobile to look behind and see what the
trouble was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything broken?&#8221; Ted wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;We seem to have broken off a small
tree,&#8221; replied Mr. Martin. &#8220;But the auto
isn&#8217;t damaged. We are chained fast to a
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chained fast to a tree!&#8221; cried Janet.
&#8220;How can that be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With one of the tire chains,&#8221; went on
Mr. Martin. &#8220;One end of a tire chain is
fast around a tree and the other end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
chain is tangled around one of the car
springs. No wonder I couldn&#8217;t move!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have happened by accident,&#8221;
replied her husband. &#8220;That chain never
got there by itself. I remember using the
chains the other day, and, instead of putting
them with the tools under the seat, I left
them in the front of the car. Some one must
have taken a chain and made us fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Martin said this he looked sharply
at Trouble, who had been sitting between
him and his wife in the front seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you do that Trouble?&#8221; asked his
mother, shaking a finger at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess maybe I did,&#8221; admitted small
William.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>know</i> that you did it?&#8221; asked
his father sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did it,&#8221; confessed Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have caused an accident,&#8221;
added Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;now&mdash;I now&mdash;jest did it so our
auto wouldn&#8217;t run away,&#8221; explained
Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Mrs. Martin. &#8220;What
will you do next, Trouble?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said, and he probably
meant it. For not even small William himself
knew what next would pop into his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s lucky no great harm was
done,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;If I had started
off too suddenly I might have broken a tire
chain. Then when we needed it to use on a
wet and slippery pavement, William, we
wouldn&#8217;t have had it. I might skid and
break a wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am&mdash;I mean yes, sir, I&mdash;I&#8217;m
sorry,&#8221; said Trouble.</p>

<p>By asking Trouble questions they learned
how it had happened. When they got out to
&#8220;stretch their legs,&#8221; as Mr. Martin called it,
William alighted with the others. Then,
when no one saw him, he took one of the
tire chains from the front of the car. He
tangled one end of the chain around the
rear spring, and the other end of the chain
he wound around the small tree.</p>

<p>Consequently, when Mr. Martin started
his machine he pulled over and broke off the
small tree, this causing the cracking, splintering
sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it might have been a lot worse,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin, as he loosed the tire chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and put it, with the second one, in the tool
box under the seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better look to make sure there&#8217;s nothing
else loose that William can make trouble
with,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Martin, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;If William makes any more trouble I&#8217;ll
send him back home to stay with Skyrocket,&#8221;
declared Mr. Martin, for the Curlytops&#8217;
dog had not been brought along on
this trip, it being thought too much bother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good,&#8221; promised the little fellow.</p>

<p>The automobile was being driven along
the pleasant country roads toward Mount
Major and the lumber camp where Mr.
Martin was going to start the store for the
lumber company that would get out the
trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they going to float the logs down
the river?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the logs will be floated that
way,&#8221; his father said. &#8220;Others will be
sawed into boards right there in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can they saw them?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men have set up a regular sawmill
there in the forest,&#8221; her father answered.
&#8220;And, before I forget it, I want to warn
you children&mdash;all of you&mdash;to keep away
from the saw.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Yes, it is very dangerous!&#8221; added Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep away,&#8221; promised Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see that William keeps away, too,&#8221;
cautioned Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon when
Mrs. Martin noticed that her husband was
speeding the automobile each chance he got
on good roads, and she also saw him often
looking at the clock on the board in front of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Are
we late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t quite as far along on our trip
as I&#8217;d like to be,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There
were more hills than I counted on. But I
think we&#8217;ll get there before dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be
very pleasant settling in a strange bungalow
after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hurry as much as is safe,&#8221; said Mr.
Martin. He put on more speed, but as they
were coming down a narrow road that led
across a small white bridge there appeared,
just ahead coming toward them around a
turn in the highway, a big load of hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never pass that!&#8221; said Ted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;Call to him to stop before he gets on the
bridge,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be wise to do that,&#8221; added Mrs.
Martin. &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t stop, or you don&#8217;t,
Dick, you&#8217;ll meet on the bridge, and there
isn&#8217;t room to pass anything as large as a
load of hay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; admitted her husband.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t very well stop on this hill
with the load I have. I say, you there!&#8221; he
called to the driver of the hay wagon. &#8220;Pull
up, will you? Wait until I pass you, please!
Don&#8217;t go on the bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether the rattle of the hay wagon
drowned Mr. Martin&#8217;s words, or whether
the farmer was deaf was not known, but the
load of dried grass kept on, and, in another
moment, it and the automobile were close
to the bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look out!&#8221; screamed Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa there!&#8221; yelled the farmer, seeing
the danger. &#8220;What you trying to do?&#8221; he
asked, rather angrily.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin did not try to answer then.
He was putting on both foot and hand
brakes with all his power. And luckily he
stopped right in front of the horses of the
hay wagon. There never would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
room for the automobile to have passed the
hay wagon on the bridge. Two automobiles,
or an ordinary wagon and an automobile
could have passed easily. But the hay stuck
out so much on either side that it took up
most of the roadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me call to you, asking
you to keep off the bridge until I had crossed
it?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, no, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the farmer,
and he smiled a little. Evidently he
was not going to get angry after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did call to you,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;I
would have stopped my car before reaching
the bridge, but I couldn&#8217;t, coming downhill
as I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I calculate &#8217;twould be pretty
middlin&#8217; hard,&#8221; admitted the farmer. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry I didn&#8217;t hear you. Now if you&#8217;ll wait
a minute I&#8217;ll try to back up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;d better let me do that,&#8221; suggested
Mr. Martin. &#8220;I can back off easier
than you can. I&#8217;ll get out and take a look at
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bridge was rather narrow, and the
road on either side leading to it was also
narrow. It was not an easy matter for either
the hay wagon or the automobile to back up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
But one or the other must do it, for they
could not pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can back up all right,&#8221; said
Mr. Martin, after looking the ground over
carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, neighbor. Sorry to put you to
all this trouble,&#8221; said the good-natured
farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. We must give and take
in this world if we are going to get along,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Martin,
as her husband was about to get back in
the machine and back it up. &#8220;I want to get
out before you try anything like that,
Dick,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And the children had
better get out also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it would be better,&#8221; her husband
agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll feel freer then to switch
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay in, Lucy?&#8221; asked
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lan&#8217; ob massy no, indeedy!&#8221; cried
the black cook, and out she scrambled.</p>

<p>The Curlytops and the others stood in the
road while Mr. Martin carefully backed his
automobile off the bridge. Ted stood at the
rear to tell his father which way to turn&mdash;whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to the right or the left&mdash;to avoid
going off the road into the ditches which
were on either side. The farmer had to remain
on his hay wagon to keep his horses
quiet, for they seemed a bit skittish at the
sound of the throbbing automobile.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Martin had backed far enough
off the bridge for the hay wagon to keep on
across it and pull out to one side so the automobile
could go ahead.</p>

<p>This was done after a while and the road
cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You folks comin&#8217; to live around here?&#8221;
asked the farmer, as the Curlytops and
others began to enter the automobile again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re just going to stay for a while
at Mount Major,&#8221; answered Mr. Martin.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to open a store for the lumbermen
who are soon to arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I heard somethin&#8217; &#8217;bout there
going to be lumberin&#8217; off at Mount Major,&#8221;
the farmer said. &#8220;Wa&#8217;al, mebby I&#8217;ll see you
again. I live not far from Mount Major.
Armstrong is my name&mdash;Silas Armstrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you, Mr. Armstrong,&#8221;
greeted Mr. Martin, as he told his own name.
&#8220;And I hope we see you again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; drawled Mr. Armstrong, as he
drove off.</p>

<p>Once more the Curlytops were in the car.
They crossed the bridge and were perhaps
half a mile down the road when Mrs. Martin
suddenly turned, looked back to where
Ted and Janet were sitting with Lucy, and
then Mrs. Martin cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s William?&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly Mr. Martin looked to where
Trouble had been sitting on the other side
of Mrs. Martin in the front seat. William
was not there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he back there with you, Janet?&#8221; asked
his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s fallen out,&#8221; cried the frantic
mother. &#8220;Dick, stop the car! William has
fallen out!&#8221;</p>

<small>AT THE FARMHOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span> acted as quickly in bringing
the automobile to a stop this time as he had
done when Trouble had fastened it to a tree
by the tire chains. Once the car was stopped
the father of the Curlytops leaped out and
looked back over the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see him anywhere,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Are you sure he isn&#8217;t in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t here with us,&#8221; answered
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless he&#8217;s slipped in among the packages,&#8221;
added Ted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef de poor chile am down in amongst
de t&#8217;ings he&#8217;s suah to be smashed!&#8221; declared
Lucy.</p>

<p>But Trouble was not there. Nor was he
in front. Mr. Martin had been sure of this
before he leaped from the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, where can he be?&#8221; cried Mrs. Martin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;He was with us just before we met the
hay wagon,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;Then we
all got out to look and see how much room
there was, and you all stayed out while I
backed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Trouble get back in with you?&#8221;
asked the Curlytops&#8217; mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Janet answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought he was in front with you,&#8221;
said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we thought he was in the rear with
you,&#8221; added Mrs. Martin. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until
I looked back to see if he might be getting
sleepy that I missed him. Oh, where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find him!&#8221; declared Mr. Martin.
&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have fallen out, or we would
have heard him yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how did he get out?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Martin anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he didn&#8217;t get in,&#8221; her husband
replied. &#8220;I mean, when all of you got back
in after the hay wagon passed Trouble
stayed out and I started off without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where can he be?&#8221; inquired Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he wandered off along the road to
pick flowers as he often does,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>The automobile was turned around and
started back over the road they had come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Eager eyes looked everywhere for a sight of
Trouble, but he was not seen. They looked
carefully near the bridge, then went on a
little farther. As Mr. Martin steered around
a bend in the road, he saw the hay wagon
again, just ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea!&#8221; he suddenly cried, as
he put on speed. As he neared the big load
of fodder, in front of which, hidden from
sight, sat the driver. Mr. Martin called:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say there! Wait a minute! Have you
seen a lost boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made his voice heard above the rattle
of the hay wagon. From in front came a
call:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses came to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Mr. Armstrong,
looking around the front edge of the hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little son William is missing,&#8221; said
Mr. Martin. &#8220;Did you see anything of him
along the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxiously Mrs. Martin waited for the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t see him!&#8221; said Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin seemed on the edge of tears
when Ted gave a sudden shout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s up on the load of hay where
we can&#8217;t see him!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he get there?&#8221; asked Jan.</p>

<p>&#8220;And wouldn&#8217;t he call to us?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Martin doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He could easily climb up,&#8221; explained
Ted. &#8220;He could get on the back of the
wagon, and there&#8217;s a thing like a ladder to
climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true enough. To keep the hay
from slipping off the end of his wagon Mr.
Armstrong had fastened there an upright,
consisting of two pieces of wood joined by
cross pieces. It was like a short ladder leading
to the top of the load of hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble could easily climb that,&#8221; insisted
Ted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him climb harder places
than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why doesn&#8217;t he answer us?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Martin solved the puzzle.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s up there maybe he&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon find out!&#8221; cried Ted.</p>

<p>A moment later he was climbing up the
little ladder at the back of the load of hay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
When he reached the top of the pile of
fodder Ted cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble was peacefully slumbering in a
little nest he had wiggled himself into on
top of the sweet-smelling hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is like Little Boy Blue!&#8221; laughed
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except that Boy Blue was under the
haystack fast asleep, and Trouble is on top
of the hay,&#8221; said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll slide him down. Catch him!&#8221; cried
Ted to his father.</p>

<p>They could hear Trouble sleepily protesting
at having been awakened. But he
soon grew good-natured, and amid the
laughter of the farmer, Janet, her mother
and Lucy, Ted and his father got the small
boy down off the load of hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you ever go up there for?&#8221;
asked his mother, as she picked wisps of hay
out of his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, jest for&mdash;now&mdash;for fun,&#8221; slowly
answered Trouble.</p>

<p>And that is how it had happened. He had
strolled around when they were all out of
the car, waiting for Mr. Martin to back it
and get it out of the way of the hay. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Trouble had seen the little ladder leading
to the top of the fodder. He had scrambled
up on a wheel when no one was watching and
climbed to the summit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was awful nice up there,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;an&#8217; I had a nice sleep, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you weren&#8217;t jiggled off!&#8221;
exclaimed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you should see the hole he was in!&#8221;
laughed Ted. &#8220;He was like a little squirrel
in a nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to be a squirrel,&#8221; declared Trouble.
&#8220;An&#8217; if I was a squirrel now I would eat a
nut for I am hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless your heart!&#8221; exclaimed his
mother, with a laugh, &#8220;I suppose you are
hungry. Well, it&#8217;s some time until supper,
but I guess I can find you something. Did
you thank Mr. Armstrong for the hay
ride?&#8221; she asked with a smile and nod at
the farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;now&mdash;thank you!&#8221; said
Trouble politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, young man,&#8221; chuckled
the farmer. &#8220;The next time you want to
ride with me let me know and I&#8217;ll put up a
lunch for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more laughter and then good-byes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
were said. The load of hay continued
on down the road, and Mr. Martin, making
sure that Trouble was now in the car, turned
the machine and started back over the road
toward Mount Major.</p>

<p>But so much time had been lost, first because
of the chaining of the car to the tree
and then the hunt for Trouble, that it was
now late afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we are going to make
it,&#8221; said Mr. Martin to his wife, as they
drove along.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean get to Mount Major before
dark?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t want to take you into the
woods with the children after dark&mdash;especially
to a strange place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of
course it will be quite a trouble, but we may
get some fun out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be lots of fun!&#8221; exclaimed Janet,
who overheard what her father and mother
were saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like camping out,&#8221; added Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Camping out is all right when you have
your camp set up,&#8221; returned Mr. Martin,
with a laugh. &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t much fun to
make camp after dark in a strange place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
with three children. So I think we had better
stay over for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Ted. &#8220;Do you mean
camp here in the woods?&#8221; and he motioned
to the forest that was then on either side
of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, we won&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; his father
answered. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go on to the next town
and stay at the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not really dressed to stop at a
fashionable hotel,&#8221; objected Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the hotels around here aren&#8217;t
very fashionable,&#8221; laughed her husband.</p>

<p>But, as it happened, they did not stay at a
hotel. The automobile was driven along until
it came out of the wooded road and was
speeding along a highway that led past a
pleasant farm, with its big white house and
green shutters and barns and outhouses
clustered near it.</p>

<p>Just as they were passing the house Mr.
Martin looked at the motormeter, or thermometer,
on the radiator of the car, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is overheating,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.
&#8220;Are you out of water?&#8221; For sometimes
when there is not enough water in the radiator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of an automobile, what little there is
boils and turns to steam, and this heat makes
the red column of alcohol on the tube go
nearly to the top. It was almost there now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have plenty of water and oil,&#8221; said
Mr. Martin. &#8220;It must be something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped the car and got out to raise
the hood. Ted also got out, for he knew a
little about cars and once or twice he had
seen things that needed fixing almost as
soon as had his father.</p>

<p>But this time it was Mr. Martin who saw
what was wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fan belt is broken,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
fan stopped whirling and that let the water
get very hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a new belt?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it will take some little time to
put it on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry! I want a good supper!&#8221;
suddenly cried Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; exclaimed his mother. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid we haven&#8217;t very much left to eat. I
counted on being in the bungalow for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin appeared to think for a moment.
He looked toward the white farmhouse
and seemed to make up his mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he said to his family. &#8220;As
long as we are going to put up over night
I&#8217;ll see if they won&#8217;t take us in here. It
will take quite a while for me to put on the
fan belt, as I&#8217;m not used to doing it. By
that time it would be quite late, and it is
several miles to the next town where there
is a hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be lovely to stay here,&#8221; said
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;But of course we can&#8217;t expect
strangers to put themselves out for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do no harm to ask, at any rate,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>He walked up to the side door of the farmhouse
and soon those waiting in the automobile
saw him talking to a pleasant-faced
woman. Matters seemed to be all right, for
Mr. Martin called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on! This lady has very kindly
consented to let us stay here over night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is good of you!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Martin, as she advanced with Ted, Janet
and Trouble, while Lucy began getting out
the bags.</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble at all,&#8221; was the answer of
the farmer&#8217;s wife. &#8220;We have plenty of
room, and often accommodate auto parties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
My husband will soon be here. He is Jed
Pitney.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pitney led the Curlytops and the
others, except Mr. Martin and Lucy, into
the sitting room. Mr. Martin was going to
help Lucy bring in the baggage.</p>

<p>As he was doing this Mr. Pitney came
in from the barn, where he had gone to
oversee the milking of the cows by his hired
man. The situation was explained to the
farmer by Mr. Martin. Then Mr. Pitney,
looking sharply at the automobile, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been carting hay.&#8221; He
pointed to some wisps of the dried fodder
dangling from the rods that supported the
top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; laughed Mr. Martin. &#8220;No,
we weren&#8217;t exactly carting hay, but we
passed a load at a tight squeeze, and then
my youngest boy climbed up on the hay
wagon and went to sleep. It was Mr. Armstrong&#8217;s
hay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silas Armstrong?&#8221; asked Mr. Pitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was his name, yes. He said he lived
around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say he did! Why, he&#8217;s a neighbor
of mine!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Pitney.
&#8220;Shake hands, Mr. Martin. I feel as if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
knew you since you&#8217;ve met my neighbor Si
Armstrong on the road. Come right in and
make yourself at home. Here, give me one
of the satchels.&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped bring in the baggage, and then,
in his loud, jolly voice, he told his wife that
Mr. Martin had met Silas Armstrong with
a load of hay. This seemed to make them
better acquainted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was given a room for herself
in which Janet and Trouble could sleep, and
Ted and his father had another room.</p>

<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s supper going to be ready?&#8221;
asked Trouble, in a loud voice after the
sleeping arrangements had been made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, dear!&#8221; whispered his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m hungry! I want my supper!&#8221;
he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall have it, my dear!&#8221;
laughed Mrs. Pitney. &#8220;I know what little
boys want,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Bread and jam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, goodie!&#8221; cried Trouble, with shining
eyes as he clapped his chubby hands.</p>

<p>It was a very good meal that was soon
set before the Curlytops and the others of
the party. Lucy insisted on being allowed
to help wait on the table, and this she was
permitted to do, much to her delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The meal and the rest afterward in comfortable
chairs freshened the travelers after
the day&#8217;s trip. And after the car had
been put in Mr. Pitney&#8217;s garage&mdash;for the
farmer had an automobile of his own&mdash;they
all sat out on the porch enjoying the pleasant
evening.</p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Pitney, noticing that
the children were rather restless, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go up in the attic
and play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that would be lovely!&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any old Indian guns there?&#8221;
asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;None that shoot,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Pitney.
&#8220;There are a lot of old-fashioned things
there, though, that you may play with,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;I&#8217;ll light a lamp and hang it in a
safe place where they can&#8217;t knock it over,
for it will be dark before long, and it&#8217;s never
very light in the attic, at best,&#8221; she told
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;Let them play in the attic.&#8221;</p>

<small>FUN IN THE ATTIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> whoops of delight that made the
old farmhouse ring, the Curlytops and
Trouble hurried after Mrs. Pitney. She
smiled and laughed with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll make you a lot of
work,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I love children,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;I have raised a family of them myself.
They won&#8217;t do any harm. There&#8217;s nothing
in the attic that can be damaged. And if
the older ones will look after their little
brother, there will be no trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his name,&#8221; said Janet, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose name?&#8221; asked Mrs. Pitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;His,&#8221; and Janet pointed to William.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll get into trouble if there&#8217;s any way
at all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;He chained the auto fast and went to
sleep on the hay wagon,&#8221; added Ted, as they
climbed the attic stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe&mdash;now&mdash;maybe I did,&#8221; admitted
Trouble, who always got his words a little
mixed when he was excited. &#8220;But now I
didn&#8217;t&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;now&mdash;I didn&#8217;t lost ma&#8217;s diamond
locket like you did, Jan!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Janet, for that was an
unhappy memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your mother lose something on this
trip?&#8221; asked Mrs. Pitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on this trip,&#8221; explained Ted. &#8220;It
was before we started. My sister and I were
playing house, and Janet borrowed mother&#8217;s
small diamond locket to dress up with. But
there was an auto accident out in front and
we ran to see that, and afterward we
couldn&#8217;t find the locket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have dropped down a crack.
But we looked everywhere,&#8221; said Janet.
&#8220;Oh, I feel so bad about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; consoled Mrs. Pitney.
&#8220;Maybe it will be found some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Janet did not believe it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jim is lost, too,&#8221; added Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Jim? Your dog?&#8221; asked the
farmer&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;No. He is a tame crow that does tricks,
and he&#8217;s worth more than a hundred dollars,&#8221;
explained Ted. &#8220;He can stand on
one leg and make a pop like a cork coming
from a bottle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you lost a crow like that,&#8221;
said Mrs. Pitney, as she arranged the lamp
in a safe place in the attic, where it would
not be knocked over if the children raced
about as they were sure to do. &#8220;One of our
neighbors had a tame crow once,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;It could say a few words, but I never
heard it pull corks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim wasn&#8217;t our crow,&#8221; Janet hastened
to explain. &#8220;He belongs to Mr. Jenk, the
man who lives next door. But he&#8217;ll give us
ten dollars if we find Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I hope you&#8217;ll find him soon,&#8221; said
Mrs. Pitney. &#8220;Now you may play with anything
you find up here,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;but
I am going to ask you to put everything
back just where you found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; promised Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll put back anything that
Trouble leaves out, for sometimes he forgets,&#8221;
said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I put back t&#8217;ings myself!&#8221; insisted
Trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Ted. &#8220;See that you
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Pitney had said, there were many
old-fashioned things in the attic for the children
to have fun with. There were moulds
for making candles, which were burned before
we had kerosene lamps or electric
lights. These candle moulds were a number
of tin tubes fastened to a frame, and Mrs.
Pitney remained up in the attic long enough
to tell the children how candles used to be
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandmother used to make them,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;She would set this mould, which
made a dozen candles at once, down in a tub
of water to keep it cool. Then she would
pour the melted tallow into each tin tube
where, before that, some cotton wicks had
been hung. The melted tallow flowed around
the wick, which was hung just in the centre,
by a little stick across the top of the mould.
Then when the tallow was cold the candles
could be lifted out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they make wax candles the same
way?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, only they used melted beeswax instead
of tallow,&#8221; said Mrs. Pitney. &#8220;Of
course the wax candles were a little nicer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
than those made of tallow, and they didn&#8217;t
smell up the room so. But I don&#8217;t know that
the wax ones gave any better light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been fun to use candles,&#8221;
said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as much fun as it sounds,&#8221; answered
the farmer&#8217;s wife. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t give half
as good light as a kerosene lamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have lickerish lights at our house,&#8221;
said Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lickerish lights?&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Pitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means electric lights,&#8221; explained
Janet. &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that big wheel over
there?&#8221; she asked, pointing to one in a corner
of the attic.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a spinning wheel,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;In the olden days my grandmother
spun the woolen yarn that was woven into
cloth or knit into socks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May we play with it?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It isn&#8217;t all there,&#8221; said Mrs. Pitney.
&#8220;Only the big wheel is left, but you
can turn it and have fun, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play engine,&#8221; decided Ted, as he
helped Mrs. Pitney move the old-fashioned
spinning wheel out into the middle of the
attic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Then Janet saw a smaller wheel somewhat
like the larger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that for little girls to spin yarn
on when their mothers spun on the big
wheel?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;The little wheel
is for spinning flax, which is different from
wool. Flax is a plant that grows. It has
blue flowers. In the olden days our grandmothers
took the stalks of the flax plant,
wet them, pounded them, and pulled the fine
fibers into threads. These very fine threads
were then spun together by the spindle on
the small flax wheel, and from the threads
linen cloth was woven at the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could take the big spinning wheel
and the flax wheel I could put them together
and have a dandy engine!&#8221; said Ted, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may take them,&#8221; said Mrs. Pitney.</p>

<p>With Janet&#8217;s help Ted set the two old-fashioned
spinning wheels together. The
larger one had a rim around it over an inch
wide, and the smaller, or flax wheel, had two
grooves around its rim.</p>

<p>&#8220;They used to put two belts of string
on the small wheel,&#8221; said Mrs. Pitney, &#8220;and
then the string belts ran to two different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
parts of the spindle,&#8221; and she showed them
about it. In this way one spindle went faster
than the other, for they were of different
sizes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daddy&mdash;he has a fan belt on his auto&mdash;but
it busted!&#8221; broke out Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard about that,&#8221; laughed Mrs.
Pitney. &#8220;Well, now you may play with the
spinning wheels,&#8221; she told Teddy.</p>

<p>He found some string for a belt and ran
it from the large wheel to the smaller. Then
when Ted turned the large wheel with his
hand the flax wheel also went around, one
on one side of the attic and one on the other
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play steamboat,&#8221; decided Ted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the captain!&#8221; cried Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I goin&#8217; to be?&#8221; Trouble wanted
to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be a passenger,&#8221; said Ted.
&#8220;You can ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to wide! I wants to be a
cap&#8217;n!&#8221; protested Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s lots of fun to be a passenger,&#8221;
soothed Janet. &#8220;Passengers can eat whenever
they want to, but the captain and engineer
have to wait until the whistle blows.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;You got suffin for me to eat?&#8221; asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you cookies,&#8221; offered Janet, for
she felt sure Mrs. Pitney would give her
some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get some for us, too,&#8221; suggested Ted to
his sister, as he tried the string belt of his
&#8220;engine&#8221; and found that it revolved the
wheels in fine fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get cookies for all of us,&#8221; offered
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; cried Trouble. &#8220;Only passjars
eat cookies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t eat until the whistle
blows,&#8221; agreed Ted. But he made up his
mind that he would himself blow a make-believe
whistle as soon as Janet came back
with the cookies.</p>

<p>The little Curlytop girl had no trouble in
getting Mrs. Pitney to give her some cookies,
and with these Janet went back to the
attic. Ted had placed two chairs in the
middle of the attic floor between the two
old-fashioned spinning wheels. One of the
chairs was a &#8220;cabin&#8221; for Passenger Trouble.
The other was the pilot house where Janet
stood to steer the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; cried Engineer Teddy, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
he stood with one hand on the spokes of the
big wheel, ready to turn it. Ted soon found
that if he turned the big wheel, the small
flax wheel would spin much faster than the
one he turned. This was because of the difference
in size. If Ted had turned the flax
wheel by hand the larger wheel would have
moved more slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; cried Teddy again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; objected Janet.
&#8220;That&#8217;s for the captain to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;say it,&#8221; agreed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;All a-board!&#8221; yelled Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say it as good as I do, but I
guess it will be good enough,&#8221; said Ted.
&#8220;Did you hear it, Trouble?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. I heard her,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you get on board&mdash;in
your cabin?&#8221; Ted wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got to have cookie first so I can eat,&#8221;
said William. &#8220;Passjars eats all time!&#8221;
And not until Janet gave him a cookie
would he get on the make-believe steamboat.</p>

<p>Teddy made noises like steam puffing out.
He turned slowly at first the big wheel, and
the one on the flax spinner began to go
around and around. Faster and faster it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
went, while Janet turned an old peck measure
she had found for the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Trouble did not pay much attention to
anything except eating his cookie. He sat
in the chair, which was his &#8220;cabin,&#8221; picking
up even the crumbs that fell. He seemed
to be very hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toot! Toot!&#8221; suddenly called Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis for me to get off?&#8221; asked William.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s the whistle for me and Janet
to eat our cookies,&#8221; Teddy answered.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose we get hungry same as
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; calmly agreed Trouble. &#8220;I
eat again, too,&#8221; and he pulled a second
cookie from his pocket. &#8220;I eat when whistle
blows,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother him&mdash;let him eat when he
wants to,&#8221; whispered Janet to Ted.</p>

<p>After a while Trouble became tired of
sitting in a chair, even if he could eat cookies
whenever he wished, and he decided he
did not want to play steamboat any more.
Teddy wouldn&#8217;t let him spin either of the
wheels for fear he might break them.</p>

<p>But the Curlytops played together, and
finally Janet got Ted to let her be &#8220;engineer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;For,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if women can vote, and
I&#8217;m going to when I grow up, they can be
engineers on a steamboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not real they can&#8217;t!&#8221; declared Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they can make believe, so there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe make believe,&#8221; Ted conceded,
and he let Janet take his place while he took
hers.</p>

<p>For a time they forgot about Trouble, so
interested were they in watching the spinning
wheels revolve, one turning the other.
Then, all at once, through the attic resounded
a jingle of bells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Santa Claus! Santa Claus!&#8221; cried a
voice they knew to be that of Trouble. &#8220;I
found Santa Claus bells!&#8221;</p>

<p>He came staggering out from a dark corner
of the attic with a leather strap of sleigh
bells dragging after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get them?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back under the roof,&#8221; answered
Trouble. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they Santa Claus bells?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They sound like them, anyhow,&#8221; admitted
Ted, for the bells gave a merry
jingle.</p>

<p>But afterward Mrs. Pitney said the bells
were those her husband&#8217;s father used when
he went sleighriding in the winter. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
bells were strapped around the horse and
jingled when he trotted over the white snow,
pulling the cutter after him.</p>

<p>It was all right for Trouble to believe
they were the bells of Santa Claus, and
really they sounded just like Christmas
chimes.</p>

<p>Trouble played with the bells awhile, and
then wandered off to look for something else.
Janet, too, tired of the spinning wheels,
though Ted did not, and Janet wandered
into another corner of the attic.</p>

<p>It was not until Ted thought of something
new to play with the big and little wheels
that he looked for his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet! Janet!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Where are
you?&#8221; The attic was cut up by many gables
and all of it could not be seen from any one
point. &#8220;Where are you, Jan?&#8221; cried Ted.</p>

<p>A banging sound answered him and then
the voice of his sister cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m locked in! I&#8217;m locked in! Help
me out, Ted!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>DOWN THE HILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy,</span> at first, did not know whether his
sister Janet was playing a joke on him or
not. The Curlytops often did play jokes,
for they were just like you children. And
more than once Janet had fooled Ted in
this way. So, thinking for a moment that
it was a joke, Ted answered and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come on, Jan! Quit your fooling!
I know a new game to play with the spinning
wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I play wif you!&#8221; offered Trouble, coming
from a dark corner of the attic, where
he had become covered with cobwebs.</p>

<p>And then Jan broke out again in a wailing
cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Teddy! Teddy! I can&#8217;t get out! I&#8217;m
locked in!&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Ted knew it was no joke. Jan&#8217;s
voice showed that she was frightened and
was crying.</p>

<p>The Curlytop boy looked all around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
attic. It had in it no closet where Janet
might have gone in and closed the door after
her, thus locking herself in. And if there
was no closet where could she be? That is
what Ted wanted to know.</p>

<p>Again came that wailing cry from Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Teddy! Teddy! Get me out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Curlytop boy was very much puzzled
and not a little frightened. Only a little
while before Janet had been close beside him
playing with the spinning wheels. Then, it
seemed but a minute, Ted turned his back
to make up some new game, and Janet had
disappeared. Now she was locked in. But
where?</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet! Janet! Where is you?&#8221; called
Trouble.</p>

<p>That is what Ted should have asked. For
right away came the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in this big trunk, Teddy. The lid
fell down and I can&#8217;t push it up and I can&#8217;t
get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! In a trunk!&#8221; yelled Ted. Now he
understood. And this was why Janet&#8217;s voice
sounded so muffled and far away. It came
from inside a big trunk, of which there were
three or four in the attic. It was as if she
had been speaking from down in the cellar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Teddy did not stop to ask how Janet had
gotten inside the trunk. There was time
enough for that after he had gotten her out&mdash;if
he could. He sprang away from the
spinning wheels and hurried over to the big
old-fashioned trunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in this one, Jan?&#8221; he asked, as
he started to raise the lid of one.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m in here,&#8221; came the answer.</p>

<p>Teddy sprang to the next trunk. Just as
he was tugging on the lid, which seemed
tightly fastened, Mrs. Martin came up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin saw what Teddy was about
to do and she called to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Teddy! Teddy! Don&#8217;t open that trunk.
Mrs. Pitney won&#8217;t like it if you open her
trunks. She was kind enough to let you
play in the attic, but you mustn&#8217;t open
trunks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>got</i> to, Mother!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you have to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause Janet&#8217;s inside!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Janet inside that trunk?&#8221; cried Mrs.
Martin. &#8220;What sort of game is that you
are playing? You shouldn&#8217;t have shut Janet
up in a trunk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, Mother!&#8221; Teddy answered.
&#8220;She got in herself and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But this delay was too much for Janet.
She could hear the talk between her mother
and Teddy. She could also hear Trouble
shuffling around the attic floor. And Janet
called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me out! Let me out! I&#8217;m smothering!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin did not stop to ask any more
questions. She fairly leaped across the
floor and, catching hold of the trunk cover,
tried to lift it up. But it would not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s caught!&#8221; explained Teddy. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why Jan couldn&#8217;t get it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a fearful moment or two Mrs. Martin
feared that the trunk had locked with a
spring catch. And she was alarmed lest
there be no key to fit it, or that the key
could not be found. In that case they would
have to chop the trunk open to get Janet out.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Martin looked at the lock
of the trunk she saw that it was merely
caught, and not fastened with a spring catch.
In an instant she pulled the piece of brass
forward and then, with Ted&#8217;s help, she
raised the lid of the trunk.</p>

<p>There was Janet, all crumpled up, lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
on a pile of old-fashioned dresses. The little
Curlytop girl&#8217;s face was very red, and it was
dirty where she had cried and then rubbed
her hands over her cheeks, her hands being
soiled with dust from the old spinning
wheels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Janet! Why did you hide in the
trunk?&#8221; asked Mrs. Martin, helping her
out. &#8220;You might have smothered in there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I &#8217;most did,&#8221; sobbed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you put her in there, Teddy?&#8221; asked
his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got in myself,&#8221; Janet hastened to say.
&#8220;I opened the trunk to look at some of the
dresses, for Mrs. Pitney said we might. And
I leaned over to see those on the bottom,
and I fell in. I slipped all the way in and
then the lid fell down and I couldn&#8217;t get
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was too bad,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin
kindly. &#8220;It&#8217;s lucky some one was up here
with you or you might have been in the
trunk a long time before you were let out.
Old trunks like this sometimes fasten with
a spring catch that is hard to open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll close this so Trouble won&#8217;t get in,&#8221;
said Ted as he lowered the lid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;I no hide in any trunks,&#8221; the little
fellow announced. &#8220;I got better place as
that. Come see,&#8221; he added, tugging at his
mother&#8217;s hand to lead her into the corner
where he had been rummaging.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe I want to go there.
I&#8217;d get covered with cobwebs like you!&#8221;
laughed Mrs. Martin. &#8220;But come, children.
It&#8217;s time you were in bed. Put things back
where you found them and we&#8217;ll go downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spinning wheels were set back against
the beams under the sloping roof of the
old-fashioned attic. Trouble wanted to
take the string of sleigh bells down to bed
with him, but this could not be allowed.
Janet gave one last look at the trunk which
had been her prison for a short time and
went with her mother and Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have fun?&#8221; asked Mrs. Pitney,
as they entered the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they had fun and a sort of adventure,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Martin, as she told
about the trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! That might have been a sad
accident,&#8221; said the farmer&#8217;s wife. &#8220;I never
thought of your tumbling into any of those
old trunks or I would have told you children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
not to open them. Not that you could do
any harm,&#8221; she added, &#8220;for the dresses are
so old-fashioned that no one would think of
wearing them, unless at some Hallowe&#8217;en
party. But I&#8217;m glad you got safely out,
Janet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; agreed the little girl.</p>

<p>Soon after this the Curlytops were in
bed. There was no need of any specially
early start in the morning, Mr. Martin said,
as they were not many miles from Mount
Major, where they were to stay in the woods
for several weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can easily get to the camp bungalow
by noon, if we start from here at nine
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Mr. Martin to his wife that
night. &#8220;We will let the children sleep as
long as they wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night passed quietly, except that
Trouble walked in his sleep, an occasional
happening, and when his mother asked him
what he wanted he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I get sleigh bells for Santa Claus.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was thinking of his play up in the
attic.</p>

<p>After a good breakfast the automobile
was brought around to the door and once
more the Curlytops prepared to travel on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Many thanks were expressed to Mr. and
Mrs. Pitney for their kindness in keeping
the family over night.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you get settled in your wood
camp drive over and see us some time,&#8221; invited
the farmer&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Mrs. Martin. &#8220;And
you must come and see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will if I ever get any time away
from the farm,&#8221; laughed Mr. Pitney.</p>

<p>Off started the automobile with the Curlytops
and the others. In a few hours they
would be in the woods and then, thought
Ted, Janet and Trouble, the real fun would
begin. For they had been counting on having
many good times in camp.</p>

<p>The roads, now, were not as good as they
had been at first, becoming rather rough
after leaving the Pitney farm. But Mr.
Martin was a good driver and sent the car
along at a good pace. He had been over
the road some time before, and thought he
knew the way. But once, coming to a place
where two roads forked, he stopped as if
puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked his wife.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know which way to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you look at the road book?&#8221;
suggested Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; offered Jan, for this auto
guide was always carried in the car, and
now she took it from one of the side pockets.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin turned the pages and looked
at the maps, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t help any,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;This road doesn&#8217;t seem to be down on the
map.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we came the wrong way?&#8221;
Mrs. Martin wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we lost?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; her father said, with a laugh.
&#8220;But I want to take the shortest road to
our place. We have been delayed enough.
I was to meet some of the lumbermen there
at noon, and if I&#8217;m not on hand they may go
away and not come back until to-morrow.
If there was only a sign-board or some one
to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no sign and not a house
was in sight. The nearest dwelling was
about a mile back. Of course Mr. Martin
could have turned and gone back there to
ask which road to take, but he did not want
to do this if he could avoid it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;I wish some one would come along,&#8221; he
remarked.</p>

<p>And then, as if in answer to his wish, the
sound of wheels and of a horse trotting,
was heard down one of the roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one is coming,&#8221; announced Janet.</p>

<p>A moment later a farmer riding in a one-horse
wagon came driving along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way to Mount Major, if you
please?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who-a-ah!&#8221; drawled the farmer slowly,
as he pulled his horse to a stop. &#8220;Mount
Major?&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Wa&#8217;al, you kin take
either road,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one is the best?&#8221; Mr. Martin
wanted to know.</p>

<p>The farmer seemed to be considering this
for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of &#8217;em&#8217;s prutty wuss!&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;They&#8217;s both bad enough, though not so
much now&#8217;s wet weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if both roads are bad,&#8221; said Mr.
Martin, with a smile at the farmer&#8217;s odd
talk and ways, &#8220;which road is the shorter?&#8221;</p>

<p>This appeared to be another puzzle. He
scratched his head and finally answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, ef anythin&#8217; the one I jest come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
over&#8217;s a leetle mite shorter, an&#8217; &#8217;tain&#8217;t so
much at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even a little difference will save us
some time,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;I&#8217;m much
obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it! G&#8217;lang!&#8221; the farmer
called to his horse, and he pulled to one side
to get around the automobile which had
stopped in the fork of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the right hand road,&#8221; said
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, later on, it won&#8217;t turn out that
we should have taken the left,&#8221; said Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, do you think something might
happen?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll get lost and have to stay
in the woods all night!&#8221; remarked Teddy.
And he said it as though he would rather
like such a thing to happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ll have any
trouble,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;I could have
gone around by Parkersburg, and we would
have had good roads all the way. But it
was thirty miles farther and I thought we
would save time this way. Well, we&#8217;ll see
what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the road the farmer had told them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to take was fairly good, though there were
stretches of sand where they could not go
fast. Then they struck a patch of woods
through which the road wound in and out
like some great snake. The trees met in
arches overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very narrow road,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Martin, when they had traveled it for
a mile or so. &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t meet any
other autos or wagons. We&#8217;d have hard
work to pass them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, so far, they had met and passed
no other vehicles. Soon, however, the road,
instead of being on the level, began to slope
downhill, and it was rather a steep hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better put on brakes here,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>He began to do this, but he had no sooner
started down the hill than he found the
brakes were not holding well. The automobile
rolled along too fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still there may be no danger if we don&#8217;t
meet another car or wagon,&#8221; thought Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>However, danger was ahead. A moment
later Janet cried and pointed to a wagon
going down the hill in front of them. It
was a wagon piled to the top with bean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
poles, and as the road was narrow and the
wagon was wide there was hardly room for
Mr. Martin to pass. And yet, tug as he did
at the brakes, he could not stop the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull over! Pull to one side and I&#8217;ll go
past you!&#8221; he called to the driver of the
wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t
room. Hold your auto back until I can get
to a wider place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Mr. Martin pulled at the brake,
but still the car rolled on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to bunk!&#8221; murmured
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good land ob massy!&#8221; cried Lucy, as she
clutched Trouble to her. &#8220;Oh, mah gracious
goodness!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span> heard the murmurs of those
in the automobile with him, and he knew
that they might become much frightened.</p>

<p>Truly there was danger of a collision with
the load of poles, as there was not room
to pass on the narrow road. And, so far,
he had not been able to stop his car. But
it was going slowly, for, though the brakes
did not hold it completely, they held it somewhat.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we bump we won&#8217;t bump very hard,&#8221;
said Ted to his sister.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man driving the load of
poles which he had cut in the woods, was
doing his best to find some place along the
narrow road where he could pull to one side.
The Curlytops were near enough now to see
that one of the rear wheels of the wagon
was sliding along in an iron &#8220;shoe.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>This is what is often used in the country,
and on heavy lumber or stone wagons, to
keep them from going downhill too fast.
The &#8220;shoe,&#8221; as it is called, is made so that
the wheel fits in it. The front of the shoe is
fastened by a chain to the body of the wagon,
and thus one wheel is dragged along the
ground, acting as a brake. It is just the
same as when you may be coasting along
on one roller skate, you drag the other foot
to act as a brake.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the automobile of the
Curlytops came to the wagon load of poles.
And just when it seemed as if they must
&#8220;bunk,&#8221; as Janet called it, though perhaps
the &#8220;bunk&#8221; would not be very hard&mdash;just
then the driver, who was walking beside his
horse, with the reins in his hand, came to a
wider place in the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll turn in here and you can pass me!&#8221;
he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;thank you!&#8221; shouted Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>Carefully he guided the automobile past
the load of poles. There was just about
room enough to pass, and not much more.
Soon after that the hill ended and they
were on level ground again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Mah good land ob goodness, Ah&#8217;s glad
dat&#8217;s ended!&#8221; sighed Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all glad,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.
&#8220;You must have your brakes looked
after, Dick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought they were
all right. Some sand must have gotten in
them from the roads. But now we&#8217;re all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were driving along a pleasant road
through the woods. All danger seemed to
be over, and Mr. Martin said he wished he
had taken the other way instead of the one
the farmer had told about as being the
&#8220;least mite shorter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes the longest way is the best,&#8221;
said Mr. Martin. &#8220;But I think we&#8217;re all
right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they were, for in about half an hour
longer they were within sight of Mount
Major, as it was called, the place where Mr.
Martin was to set up the store for the lumbermen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a lovely place!&#8221; cried Janet,
as they caught a glimpse of it from a hill
just before reaching it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good place to fish,&#8221; observed Ted. &#8220;I
see a lake and a river.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;I fish, too!&#8221; cried Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doan yo&#8217; fall in!&#8221; warned Lucy, hugging
the little fellow, who, in spite of his
mischief, was her special favorite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is plenty of water around
here,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;There needs to be
on account of the lumber. Well,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any of the men here yet. I
guess I&#8217;m in plenty of time. I was afraid
I&#8217;d be late. Now we&#8217;ll unpack and get something
to eat. I suppose you&#8217;re hungry,
aren&#8217;t you, Curlytops?&#8221; he asked, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible!&#8221; announced Ted. &#8220;Can we
cook dinner over a campfire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, some time,&#8221; his father said.
&#8220;But I think there&#8217;s an oil stove in the
bungalow and that will be better when we&#8217;re
in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s buffalo?&#8221; asked Trouble, looking
around. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any buffalo. Has
him got a hump on his back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of a camel!&#8221; laughed
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a buffalo had a sort of hump up near
his head,&#8221; remarked Teddy. &#8220;But what
makes him ask about a buffalo, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means <i>bungalow</i>&mdash;the place where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
we&#8217;re going to live,&#8221; explained Mrs. Martin
with a smile. &#8220;There it is, children, over
under the trees. Oh, what a fine place!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a driveway at one side of the
bungalow, which was made of logs, and, a
little farther on, a shed where the automobile
could be kept. Leading down from
the front door was a path, and this extended
to a lake, the waters of which were as blue as
the sky. Flowing into this lake, not far
from the bungalow, was a small river.</p>

<p>All around the lake, along the river and
surrounding the bungalow were trees, trees,
trees&mdash;so many that the Curlytops never
could have counted them all. And here and
there, in cleared places where the trees had
been cut down, were rough buildings, made
from logs and &#8220;slabs,&#8221; that is, half-rounded
pieces of wood that are sawed from logs to
make the timbers square and true.</p>

<p>Over the door of one of the buildings was
a sign:</p>

<p class="center">GENERAL STORE</p>

<p>Seeing this Janet cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that where you are going to keep
store, Daddy?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly going to <i>keep</i> store,&#8221; her
father replied. &#8220;I came up here to get the
store started and to show the men how to
run it. They will be cutting lumber here the
rest of the summer and all winter, and they
will want to buy things from the store, as
some of the lumbermen are bringing their
families with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As yet none of the lumbermen had arrived,
for the camp was not to open for a few days.
It was needful to start the store first so the
men would have something to eat when they
should arrive.</p>

<p>Piled about the building that was marked
with the store sign were many boxes and
barrels. The Curlytops had seen such packages
before at their father&#8217;s store in
Cresco, and they knew what the boxes and
barrels held&mdash;sugar, canned goods, dried
fruits, tea, coffee, oatmeal, overalls, hats and
all the things that go to make up a general
store. All these goods must be taken out of
their packages and arranged on the shelves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we help in the store, Daddy?&#8221;
asked Ted, as his father started toward the
bungalow, to open it with a key he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I guess so,&#8221; was the answer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
&#8220;I expect a couple of men up to do the heavy
work. They ought to be here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bungalow was opened and the Curlytop
family went inside. The more they saw
of the place the better they liked it. There
was a large living-room with a great fireplace,
a dining-room and a kitchen on the
first floor, and upstairs were bedrooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are dishes in the pantry, too!&#8221;
announced Janet, as she came back from
having looked around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything to put on the dishes?&#8221;
asked Ted, laughing. &#8220;I mean anything to
eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to know, too,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon have something ready,&#8221; promised
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;Come, Lucy, we must
feed these hungry animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bear&mdash;that&#8217;s what I is!&#8221; cried
Trouble, and he pretended to growl like a
bear to show how hungry he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over and take a look at the store,&#8221;
announced Mr. Martin. &#8220;There&#8217;s wood
already cut for the fire,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll attend to things,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.
&#8220;Just bring in the food from the auto
and we&#8217;ll soon have a meal ready.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Mr. Martin and Ted brought in the baskets
of victuals that had been brought along,
and then the Curlytop boy and his father,
with Trouble trailing after them, went
toward the building that soon was to be
made into a store for the lumbermen to
trade at. Janet remained in the bungalow
to help her mother and Lucy.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin had a key to the store building
and, opening it, he and the boys went
inside. All there was to be seen now were
empty shelves and counters.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this will be a busy place in a few
days,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;If those men
were here now I could put them to opening
the boxes and barrels. Maybe they&#8217;ll come
after dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went outside to count how many boxes
and barrels there were piled up around the
steps of the store, and while he was doing
this Ted and Trouble roamed about the
clearing in the woods where the different
buildings were put up. Some were for the
men to sleep in, another was a kitchen,
where food would be prepared, and at the
sight of one large building, with a smoke stack
sticking through the roof, Ted cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that the sawmill?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the sawmill,&#8221; his father answered.
&#8220;But you must never go in there
unless I am with you. It&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we go with mother?&#8221; Ted
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, with your mother. But there
is a very big saw in there to cut up the logs,
and it would not only cut off your finger, if
you got too close, but it would do worse. So
keep away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted and Trouble promised that they
would, and they teased their father so hard
to take them to the sawmill now that, after
he had looked over the groceries and other
supplies, he consented.</p>

<p>Leading from the mill down into the lake
was a sort of small railroad track, sloping
like a little hill. And in the middle of the
track, and extending up into the mill, was
a big chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That chain pulls the logs up from the
river, along this inclined runway, into
the mill,&#8221; answered Mr. Martin. &#8220;Once the
logs are in the mill they are put on a sort of
platform, or on a traveling cradle, and then
machinery pushes them close to the big buzz
saw and they are cut up into boards.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Is it a cat&#8217;s cradle?&#8221; Trouble wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly,&#8221; laughed Mr. Martin.
&#8220;Come in and I&#8217;ll show you. The mill isn&#8217;t
running now, but it soon will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the chain pull the logs up all by
itself?&#8221; Ted asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; his father replied. &#8220;A steam engine
winds the chain up on what is called a
drum, just as a rope is wound up on a derrick.
In fact, this runway is like a derrick,
only it is stretched out on the ground instead
of being up in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were much interested in looking
over the machinery of the lumber mill, and
they wished for the day to come when it
would start&mdash;when the engine would puff
and clouds of smoke and steam would pour
from the big stack in the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I hear your mother calling,&#8221; said
Mr. Martin, after a while. &#8220;We&#8217;d better
have something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted and Trouble had been so eager to look
around that for a time they had forgotten
about being hungry. However, as their
father now spoke of it they hurried on to
the bungalow. In the door stood Lucy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
beating on the bottom of a tin pan with a
big spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dish yeah am de dinnah gong,&#8221; she
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Teddy, for he felt so
glad and happy at coming to camp in the
woods that he wanted to stand on his head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin, with the help of Janet and
Lucy, had gotten a fine meal ready, and they
were all so hungry that they greatly enjoyed
it. When it was almost over Janet,
looking from the open door out toward the
lake, saw a boat approaching, in which were
two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, two tramps are coming!&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Will you give them something to
eat, Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin looked to where his little
daughter pointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those aren&#8217;t tramps,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have terribly ragged clothes on,&#8221;
said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think because a man wears
old and ragged clothes that he is always a
tramp,&#8221; went on Mr. Martin. &#8220;I think
those are the two lumbermen who are coming
to help me set up the store. And on
account of their rough work, lumbermen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
cannot go about dressed up. Yes,
they&#8217;re lumbermen,&#8221; he said, as he saw the
two step from the boat, carrying their axes
and some big hooks, with long, heavy handles,
by which logs are turned over and put
into place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Mr. Martin?&#8221; asked one of the
men, as the father of the Curlytops walked
down the path toward the lake to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we were sent to help you in the
store,&#8221; went on one of the men. &#8220;The rest
of the crowd will be over to-morrow. My
name is Jack Nestor and this is my partner,
Henry Hart,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to know you,&#8221; replied Mr. Martin.
&#8220;Well, there is plenty to do, and the sooner
we get started the better. Come on, I&#8217;ll
show you what&#8217;s to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Mr. Martin was busy with those
who were to be his helpers, and while Mrs.
Martin, Lucy and Janet were clearing away
the dinner things, Ted and Trouble wandered
off through the woods. It was a most
delightful place, Ted decided.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best one I&#8217;ve ever been to on vacation,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Trouble, too, seemed to like it, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
here and there in the woods. Then the little
fellow had one of his many ideas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make me a whistle?&#8221; he asked
his brother. &#8220;I want a whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess I can make you a willow
whistle,&#8221; said Ted, as he took out his knife.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a willow tree growing over there.&#8221;
He pointed to one near the bank of the lake,
and soon he and Trouble were sitting on a
mossy log under the drooping willow tree
while Ted cut a branch and was fashioning
it into a whistle for his brother.</p>

<p>Ted cut the bark around and pounded it
to soften it so it could be slipped off, for this
must be done if a whistle is rightly made.
Ted used the handle of his knife to pound
the bark lightly. Then he laid his knife
down on the log and began to twist off the
piece of bark.</p>

<p>While waiting for his brother to do this
Trouble had wandered about the little clearing
under the willow tree. Before Ted
knew it Trouble was out of his sight, and,
hearing the little fellow tramping in the
underbrush, Ted started up after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, come back!&#8221; he called to Trouble.</p>

<p>Trouble was headed for the lake, and he
had been told he must not go there alone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;Come back here, you little tyke!&#8221; cried
Ted. &#8220;First you know you&#8217;ll fall in and I&#8217;ll
have to fish you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw right, I come back,&#8221; agreed Trouble,
stopping short. He feared if he did not
mind he would get no whistle. &#8220;I just go to
see maybe if fish in lake,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell by looking at a lake if it
has fish in it or not,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;Now
you stay by me if you want that whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boys started back toward the log
on which they had been sitting, they saw a
strange sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; cried Trouble, pointing
with a chubby finger toward the log. &#8220;Look
at black bird takin&#8217; my whistle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t taking your whistle, I have
that here!&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a crow
and he&#8217;s after something. Oh, he&#8217;s got my
knife!&#8221; he cried a moment later, as the big,
black bird rose from the log, with something
glittering held fast in his bill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>TROUBLE IN THE STORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Caw!</span> Caw! Caw!&#8221; came a hoarse cry,
as the black bird fluttered up off the log,
carrying away Ted&#8217;s bright and glittering
knife, for crows like to take bright things,
you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221; again sounded the
cry.</p>

<p>Then Ted and Trouble noticed that it was
not the crow that had the knife that
was doing the cawing. It was some other
crow farther off in the woods. For if
the crow that had flown down and picked
up Ted&#8217;s knife from the log had opened its
mouth to caw, it would have had to drop the
knife. A crow must open its beak to call,
just as you have to open your mouth to sing,
or as a dog opens its mouth to bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop my knife! Drop my knife, you
funny black crow!&#8221; cried Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frow suffin&#8217; at him! Frow suffin&#8217;!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
cried Trouble, so eager and excited that he
forgot to talk straight. &#8220;Frow suffin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll throw something all right!&#8221; shouted
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t frow my whistle,&#8221; begged
Trouble.</p>

<p>Ted had been about to do this, forgetting
that the stick he held in his hand was the
one on one end of which he had started
the whistle for his small brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll throw a stone!&#8221; cried the Curlytop
boy.</p>

<p>Off in the woods sounded the caw of that
other crow. And, just as Ted threw a stone
at the black bird that had picked up his
knife, though Ted did not hit the crow, the
feathered thief with the knife in his beak
opened his mouth and sent out an answering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course as soon as it opened its mouth
down fell the knife, and away the crow flew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made him drop it!&#8221; cried Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he had to drop it to caw,&#8221; said
Ted, which was more like the truth, for the
stone he had thrown did not come anywhere
near the crow. &#8220;I hope I find my knife,&#8221;
Teddy went on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>He ran toward the place where he had
seen it fall from the crow&#8217;s beak, and as the
bird circled overhead, crying and cawing in
answer to the other, which the boys did not
see, Ted and his brother searched amid the
leaves for the missing knife.</p>

<p>After poking about for some time they
picked it up, and Ted looked at it carefully
to see if it might be damaged. But it was
none the worse from having been nearly
carried off by the crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made him want it?&#8221; asked Trouble,
as the whistle-making started again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess maybe he wanted to give it
to his little boy,&#8221; Ted answered, with a
laugh, as he carefully whittled away at the
whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has crows got little boys?&#8221; Trouble
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so; and little girls, too,&#8221;
explained Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can a crow boy cut with a
knife?&#8221; persisted William. &#8220;How can
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess maybe he doesn&#8217;t, except
in fairy stories,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes crows caw?&#8221; was Trouble&#8217;s
next question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way they talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, does crows talk?&#8221; eagerly cried
Trouble. He listened a moment. Over the
trees floated a cry of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s him crow sayin&#8217;?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; Ted had to confess.
&#8220;You ask too many questions, Trouble! I
can&#8217;t answer half of &#8217;em. Crows must talk
among themselves same&#8217;s dogs talk when
they rub noses and wag their tails. Now
there&#8217;s your whistle. Blow on it and then
you can&#8217;t ask so many questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shut his knife and put it in his pocket,
while Trouble put the blowing end of the
whistle in his lips. It gave forth a shrill,
clear sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;At&#8217;s a fine whistle!&#8221; Trouble said.
&#8220;Thanks you, Ted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, boysie! I&#8217;m glad you like it.
That&#8217;s it&mdash;toot away!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Trouble blew harder on the whistle
several birds in the trees seemed to sing in
answer. And again, over the trees, came the
hoarse voices of the crows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw-aw-aw!&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they wants a whistle,&#8221; suggested
Trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; agreed Ted, with a laugh.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to make them any.
That was a bold fellow to come down and
take my knife like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Ted and Trouble reached the
bungalow and told what had happened,
Janet said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted! Maybe that was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s
tame crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, the one that tried to fly away with
my knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, maybe that was Jim, the lame crow,
and if you could have caught him we&#8217;d get
ten dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t Jim crow,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he wasn&#8217;t lame,&#8221; answered her
brother. &#8220;I watched him walk along on the
log &#8217;fore he picked up my knife and he
didn&#8217;t limp a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s lame, tame
crow,&#8221; persisted Janet, &#8220;but maybe he got
well after he flew off to the woods, and
maybe he&#8217;s here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted shook his head in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too far away for Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow
to come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And he couldn&#8217;t get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
well. He was lame from a broken leg and
Mr. Jenk said Jim would always be lame
like he was &#8217;cause one leg was shorter than
the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; murmured Janet. &#8220;Well, anyhow,
I&#8217;m glad he didn&#8217;t take your knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; agreed Teddy.</p>

<p>There were now busy times at Mount
Major; at least for Mr. Martin, as he must
watch over and tell the two men, Jack and
Henry, as they called themselves, about putting
the groceries and merchandise away on
the shelves. In another day or two the
lumbermen would arrive and there would
be more busy scenes in the woods where the
Curlytops were spending their vacation.</p>

<p>By the time the boxes and barrels of supplies
had been unpacked and placed on the
shelves, some of the lumbermen arrived.
There were men who chopped down the
great trees, other men who piled them on
skids and wagons and hauled them to the
lake or river, where they were sent down
long slides, or chutes, then to be floated to
the mill.</p>

<p>In parts of the woods too far from the
water, the logs were carted to the mill on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
wagons and piled up outside to wait for the
sawmill to cut them into lumber.</p>

<p>There was a special &#8220;gang&#8221; of men to
operate the sawmill, and this was the place
Ted best liked to linger near. He was much
interested in machinery. Trouble was, too,
and went with his brother each time Ted
started for the mill.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martin had said, some of the lumber
workers brought their families to the
woods with them, and these men, women and
children were given homes in small cabins
that were specially built for them.</p>

<p>In about a week after the Curlytops had
arrived at the bungalow in the woods, Mount
Major was a very lively place. The store
was opened and doing business. Mr. Martin
acted as manager of the store for a time, and
he had several clerks to wait on the customers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny to see a store in the woods
like this,&#8221; said Janet to her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but when men work they must eat,
and to eat they have to buy things,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Martin with a smile. &#8220;Besides,
your father makes money by coming up here
to start the store. And if we had no money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
we could not have things to eat and things
to wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Janet, with a smile.</p>

<p>Most of that first week was spent in getting
things to rights about the camp and in
setting up the store. Then, too, the sawmill
had to be made ready, so at first no trees
were cut.</p>

<p>But at last the day came when lumbering
was really started, and as a special treat the
Curlytops and Trouble were taken by their
mother to watch one of the big trees being
felled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we be safe here?&#8221; she asked one
of the choppers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;The tree will
fall over that way,&#8221; and he waved his hand
toward an open place in the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, how can he tell just where the
tree is going to fall?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they have a way of knowing,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends on the way we chop it,&#8221;
explained the lumberman, who overheard
what Janet had asked. &#8220;It takes practice,
but we can make a tree fall anywhere we
want it to.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this proved to be the case. Two men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
chopped at the big trunk, one on either side.
Their bright axes flashed in the sunshine
and the white chips flew about.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must come back here after the tree
is cut, and pick up some of the chips,&#8221; said
Mrs. Martin to the children. &#8220;Chips are
fine for putting on the fire to make the tea-kettle
boil quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could chop a tree,&#8221; sighed
Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mustn&#8217;t ever touch one of the
men&#8217;s axes!&#8221; warned Mrs. Martin, for she
could read Trouble&#8217;s mind at times. &#8220;They
are so sharp they would cut you badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re shiny, too,&#8221; said Trouble. &#8220;I
guess maybe a crow would like to carry one
off like they took your knife, wouldn&#8217;t they,
Ted?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho! A crow would have a fine
time trying to fly away with an axe!&#8221;
laughed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but if maybe six ten dozen crows&mdash;now&mdash;tried
to take a axe they could&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
they, Mother?&#8221; asked the little
fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the answer
Mrs. Martin thought it safest to make.</p>

<p>Chop! Chop! Chop! went the sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
axes to the trunk of the tree. Soon the top
part began to quiver and sway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! She&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221; cried
one of the lumbermen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better run back, children!&#8221; said
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay where you are, lady! You&#8217;ll be all
right,&#8221; advised the head chopper.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Down went the tree, and just as the lumberman
had said, it fell in exactly the spot
picked out for it, and nowhere near the place
where Mrs. Martin stood with the Curlytops
and Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Teddy. &#8220;Good work!&#8221;
He had often heard his father say that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you liked it,&#8221; laughed one of the
men.</p>

<p>Then they began trimming from the tree
the branches, so the log could be taken to the
mill, either being floated down the river or
carted on the wagon or skids. The skids
formed a sort of long, low sled with wooden
runners, and in smooth places this could be
pulled over the ground, dragging logs where
they were needed.</p>

<p>That night, after a pleasant day in the
woods, during which the Curlytops had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
much fun, Janet watched her mother laying
aside some rings and a breastpin, as Mrs.
Martin was getting ready for bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t find the little diamond locket
I lost, did you, Mother?&#8221; asked Janet wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; she went on, as she
saw the sad look on Janet&#8217;s face. &#8220;Perhaps
we may find it sometime, though when I
didn&#8217;t come across it after we packed up to
come here, I began to lose hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; murmured Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said her mother kindly,
and Janet went to bed to dream that she had
found the locket and that the diamond in it
had grown as large as an orange. When
she awakened and found it only a dream, she
was very much disappointed.</p>

<p>However, the day that dawned was such
a bright and pleasant one and there was the
prospect of so much fun in the woods that
Janet could not long be sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on out and play!&#8221; called Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have fun!&#8221; added Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play camping out in the woods,&#8221;
said Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make believe we&#8217;re the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
early settlers like the Pilgrims we read
about in our school books, Ted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be fun,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not goin&#8217; to take any pills!&#8221; objected
Trouble, as he heard that strange word. &#8220;I
not sick and I not take pills!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to take pills!&#8221; laughed
Janet. &#8220;We were talking about the Pilgrims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is them?&#8221; Trouble wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they used to fight with the Indians,&#8221;
said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den I be a Pigwim!&#8221; announced
Trouble, which was as near as he could say
it. &#8220;Does Pigwims eat?&#8221; he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they do!&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
go to the store and get daddy to give us
things to eat in the woods,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin was glad to have the children
roam in the woods in play, and he gave them
some packages of crackers for their lunch.
While he was wrapping them up for Teddy
and Janet, baby William wandered behind
the store counter. A lumberman entered
as Mr. Martin finished giving the Curlytops
what they had asked for. Looking behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the counter the lumberman gave a start and
suddenly cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s trouble here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know Trouble is here,&#8221; said Mr.
Martin, thinking the man meant the little
boy. &#8220;Come out, Trouble!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I mean there&#8217;s a different kind
of trouble!&#8221; exclaimed the man. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mean your boy, though he may have been the
cause of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cause of what?&#8221; asked Mr. Martin,
starting for the counter behind which he had
seen William wander.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cause of the molasses running all
over,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;The spigot of the
barrel is open and there&#8217;s a big puddle of
molasses on the floor. It&#8217;s growing bigger!</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out there, young man!&#8221; he quickly
cried, taking a step forward. &#8220;Look out,
or you&#8217;ll sit in it. Oh, too late!&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;He&#8217;s gone and done it! Right in the
molasses he is! Right in the molasses!&#8221;</p>

<small>TED IS CAUGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Trouble</span> grunted. Then he grunted again.
Then he tried to get up from the floor where,
as the lumberman said, the little fellow had
sat down in a puddle of molasses.</p>

<p>But Trouble found he couldn&#8217;t get up.
His clothing stuck to the messy, sweet stuff
and thus was held to the floor, almost as if
it had been tacked there.</p>

<p>Then Trouble began to cry.</p>

<p>His father had run around the end of the
counter to look behind it as soon as the lumberman
spoke of the molasses. Ted and
Janet followed their father. Thus all of
them saw the trouble poor Trouble was in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is stuck!&#8221; cried Ted, hardly able
to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor dear!&#8221; murmured Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get you up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t go near him, or you&#8217;ll get in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the molasses, too,&#8221; warned Mr. Martin.
&#8220;Stay where you are, Janet. I&#8217;ll lift Trouble
out. Don&#8217;t cry, William,&#8221; he added
kindly, as he saw tears rolling down the
little fellow&#8217;s face. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t help it&mdash;I
suppose,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;That is, unless
you opened the spigot of the molasses
barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only&mdash;now&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;now&mdash;only opened
it a little bit of a way,&#8221; sobbed Trouble. &#8220;I
wanted to see&mdash;now&mdash;how fast it would run
out and it runned out an&#8217; I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t shut
it off! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum! I must put a lock on my molasses
barrels if you are going to be around the
store,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. He had first
reached over Trouble&#8217;s head and shut off the
stream of sweet stuff which no longer dribbled
out on the floor. Then Mr. Martin lifted
Trouble from his sticky seat, having to pull
rather hard to get the little fellow up from
the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but you need a bath!&#8221; cried Daddy
Martin, holding Trouble as far away from
him as possible so the dripping molasses
would not soil his own clothes. &#8220;I guess
I&#8217;ll dip you in the lake,&#8221; he added, with a
laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes, give me a swim!&#8221; cried Trouble,
thinking now only of this new fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I will,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Your
clothes will have to be soaked, anyhow, to
get the molasses off, and I may as well soak
you and them at the same time. It&#8217;s a warm
day&mdash;just right for a bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, may we go in, too?&#8221; begged Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d rather you wouldn&#8217;t now,&#8221; his
father said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, we&#8217;re going to play Pilgrims,&#8221;
said Janet. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for you, Trouble,&#8221;
she went on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait until you get
cleaned up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Telling one of the clerks in the store to
have the puddle of molasses mopped up and
asking another man to look after things
while he was gone, Mr. Martin took Trouble
down to the lake, which was not far from
the woodland store.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world are you going to do,
Dick?&#8221; cried Mrs. Martin, as, coming over
from the bungalow, she saw her husband on
his way to the lake with baby William.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy goin&#8217; put me in water!&#8221; cried
Trouble, now as much delighted as he had
been frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; asked his mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;He sat in the molasses!&#8221; answered Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he opened the barrel and it all ran
out on the floor,&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Trouble!&#8221; sighed his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;There didn&#8217;t much molasses run out,&#8221;
corrected Mr. Martin. &#8220;Only about a quart,
I guess, for he couldn&#8217;t get the spigot all the
way open.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told what had happened, and said he
thought the best way was to wash Trouble
and his sticky clothes at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a good way,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Martin.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, though, Dick. You go clean
yourself off and get back to the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I need a little scrubbing myself,&#8221;
admitted Mr. Martin, with a laugh,
as he looked at the spots of molasses that
had dripped from Trouble to his trousers.
Luckily they were an old pair that he had
put on to do some rough work about the
store, and he could easily change them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis lots ob fun!&#8221; announced Trouble, as
his mother sat him down in the shallow
water at the edge of the lake. &#8220;I go swimmin&#8217;
wif my clothes on! Ho! Ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s fun for you,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;But it makes a lot of work for Lucy.
She&#8217;ll have to wash and iron your clothes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
I don&#8217;t suppose there is much use in telling
you not to do it again, for I don&#8217;t believe you
will do that same thing again. But you&#8217;ll
do something just as bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>And those of you who know Trouble will,
no doubt, agree with Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Everything comes to an end at last, and
so did the cleaning of Trouble. Dressed in
dry garments, he went off with his brother
and sister to the woods to play &#8220;Pigwim,&#8221;
as he called it.</p>

<p>The children had with them some packages
of crackers and other good things to
eat for their lunch, and they hoped to have
a lot of fun. Nor were they disappointed,
for it was a lovely day to wander out among
the trees of the forest.</p>

<p>The Curlytops and their little brother
played &#8220;Pigwim&#8221; in the woods, pretending
to be early Pilgrim Father settlers in fear
of an attack by the Indians. Ted took the
part of the Indians and made believe attack
the log cabin of Trouble and Janet. The log
cabin was made by piling some twigs the
lumbermen had left against an old stump.
Afterwards Ted pretended to chase Trouble
and Janet through the woods and they hid
away from him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>The children finally became tired of this
game and started another. Then it was
&#8220;time to eat,&#8221; as Trouble said, so they found
a flat stump for a table and spread out on it
the lunch their father had given them from
the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it taste good?&#8221; asked Ted of his
sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful good,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better&#8217;n it does at home,&#8221; added Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ike it, too,&#8221; declared Trouble.</p>

<p>As I suppose you have all noticed, a picnic
lunch, even if it is only crackers or bread
and butter, tastes better than the finest meal
served on plates with silver knives and forks
and a spotless tablecloth.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when the children were eating
the last of their lunch, they heard a crackling
in the bushes near them, and Trouble
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bear!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was nothing of the sort. It was
only a couple of the lumbermen breaking
their way through the underbrush and slashing
at it with their sharp axes.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE AND THEN THE GREAT<br />
TRUNK CRASHED TO THE GROUND.<br />


&#8220;The Curlytops in the Woods.&#8221;  <span class="gap">    Page <a href="#Page_144">144</a></span></p>


<p>&#8220;Hello, kiddies!&#8221; greeted one of the men,
with whom the Curlytops had been friendly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;d better run away from here now,&#8221;
he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a bear comin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; laughed the man. &#8220;But we&#8217;re
going to cut down some trees near here, and
you might get hurt. Better run home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we stay and watch you cut?&#8221;
asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you get in a safe place,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put them where they won&#8217;t get hit,&#8221;
said the other man.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Curlytops and Trouble
were led to a secure place between some big
rocks and tall trees, and there they could
have a good view of the chopping work.
Even if some branches should fall near
them, the rocks and trees would keep the
toppling wood off.</p>

<p>Then began the chopping of a giant of the
forest. First one and then the other of
the big lumbermen would send his axe biting
deep into the wood of the tree they had
marked to chop down.</p>

<p>Chip! Chop! Chip! Chop! sounded the
axes, ringing out in the woods. Silently
the children watched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221; suddenly cried
Ted.</p>

<p>He had seen the top of the tree begin to
quiver and shake, and he had learned to
know that this meant the center had been
chopped through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand clear!&#8221; rang out the cry of the
lumbermen, to warn anyone who might
chance to be coming and who did not know
what was going on.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and then
the great trunk crashed to the ground,
breaking in its fall many smaller trees and
the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I grow up I&#8217;m going to cut trees
down,&#8221; declared Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather plant them and see them
grow,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they didn&#8217;t cut trees down we
wouldn&#8217;t have any houses to live in,&#8221; Teddy
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose so,&#8221; agreed his sister. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s kind of sad to see a big tree that took
years and years to grow chopped down in a
few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the days that followed the Curlytops
had wonderfully good times in the woods.
They watched the men chop down trees, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
saw the big logs floated down the lake or
river to the mill, or else saw them skidded
along through the forest to be sawed up into
planks.</p>

<p>The sawmill itself was a place of great
delight, and the children spent more time
there than anywhere else. But they were
told to be very careful, and were not allowed
to go close to the giant saw unless their
father or mother or one of the men went
with them.</p>

<p>One day, when Trouble was not feeling
very well&mdash;though his illness was only a
childish complaint that would soon pass&mdash;Ted
and Janet started for the woods together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; their mother
asked them as they started off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no place special,&#8221; answered Ted.
&#8220;I thought maybe I could catch a crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch a crow? What for?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could catch one maybe I could tame
it and teach it tricks,&#8221; replied the boy.
&#8220;And then I could sell it to Mr. Jenk in
place of his lame, tame crow that flew
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d pay us a lot of money,&#8221; added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Janet, who had been talked into this plan by
her eager brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have a lot of trouble
catching a crow,&#8221; laughed their mother.
&#8220;And even if you do get one, you could
never tame it. Now don&#8217;t get into danger,&#8221;
she added, as they walked off through the
trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; they promised.</p>

<p>And they really meant to. It only goes to
show that you never can tell what will happen
in the woods.</p>

<p>At first Ted had an idea that it would be
easy to catch a crow. He had made a sort
of trap from a box that could be turned upside
down and held raised at one end with
a stick. To the stick was fastened a string.
Ted thought it was a fine trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll raise the box,&#8221; he explained to Janet,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll put some corn under it. Crows
like corn. I&#8217;ll be hiding off in the bushes
with the end of the string in my hand. Then
when a crow goes under the box to get the
corn, I&#8217;ll pull the string and down will come
the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;And the crow
will be under it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Ted, &#8220;the crow will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
under it and we can take him out and tame
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not as easy as it sounded. In
the first place crows seemed very scarce that
day. And it was not until the Curlytops had
tramped over a mile that they heard the distant
cawing of one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve got to the right place,&#8221;
whispered Ted, as he heard the &#8220;caw! caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, set the trap now,&#8221; agreed Janet.</p>

<p>Accordingly the box was propped up on
the stick and Ted, with the end of the string
in his hand, hid off behind a distant bush
with Janet, where they could watch the
scattered corn under the box.</p>

<p>But though the cawing of the crows
sounded nearer, none came to the trap, and
after a long wait the Curlytops thought they
had better try a new place. They did, but
all they caught in their trap was a hoptoad,
and this they soon let go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe we&#8217;ll catch a crow some
other day,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; agreed his sister.</p>

<p>They wandered on through the pleasant
woods, and soon Ted cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, there goes a fox!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; cried Janet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;In that hollow log,&#8221; and Ted pointed to
one on the ground&mdash;an old giant of a fallen
tree which had rotted from the inside until
it was quite hollow, like a pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
in and catch that fox,&#8221; decided Ted. &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather catch a fox, any day, than a crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s bigger,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>Neither of them stopped to think that it
might be dangerous for a small boy to crawl
into a hollow log after a fox. For though
a fox is rather a cowardly creature, slinking
around only at night to catch hens out of the
coop, still a fox has sharp teeth, and, cornered
in a hollow log, one would make a
savage fight to get away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll crawl in and get him,&#8221; said Ted, as
he and his sister reached the hollow log.
&#8220;You stand at the other end,&#8221; he directed
Janet, &#8220;and if he comes out there, grab
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t he bite?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; declared Ted. And that was
all he knew about it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;d better poke a long stick in
and drive him out that way,&#8221; suggested
Janet. &#8220;It&#8217;s better&#8217;n crawling in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted thought of this for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try it,&#8221; he agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>He thrust the longest pole he could find
into the hollow log, but no fox ran out the
other end into the waiting hands of Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I can&#8217;t quite reach him,&#8221; decided
Ted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll crawl in after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took off his coat to make the crawling
easier, and started in at one end of the hollow
log. Janet, as directed, was at the other
end to be ready in case the fox ran out.</p>

<p>Teddy&#8217;s head disappeared from sight inside
the log. Then his body wiggled in and
lastly his legs vanished. All that stuck out
were his two feet, and from her end of the
log Janet saw these waving up and down
and from side to side. But they did not disappear.
They remained outside the log.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you crawl all the way in,
Ted?&#8221; asked his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t,&#8221; came the muffled answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t? Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;m stuck! I&#8217;m stuck! Oh,
Janet, I&#8217;m stuck in the log and I can&#8217;t get
out!&#8221; wailed Teddy.</p>

<small>ALONE IN THE WOODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was not the first time Teddy had
gotten in trouble when he and Janet were
alone together. Often it happened at home,
and so the Curlytop girl was not as much
surprised as she might have been if this was
the first time.</p>

<p>Janet left the end of the log where she
was keeping guard, to catch the fox if it
should rush out, and she hurried around to
the end in which Ted had crawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you crawl in any farther?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>The still muffled voice of her brother
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t crawl a bit more! I&#8217;m
stuck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Janet, in the most
natural way possible, &#8220;never mind about the
fox. We don&#8217;t want him anyhow. Crawl
out and we&#8217;ll go home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;But I <i>can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; cried Teddy, and now his
voice sounded as if he might be going to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can&#8217;t you do?&#8221; Janet wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t crawl out!&#8221; By this time Teddy
was very much frightened. Janet could
tell that by the catch in his voice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
crawl in and I can&#8217;t back up. I&#8217;m stuck!
I&#8217;m stuck! You&#8217;d better go and get some one
to help me out!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Janet was not going to run away so
soon. She made up her mind to try something
herself first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take hold of your feet and pull you
out,&#8221; she offered. &#8220;Keep your feet still,
now!&#8221; she commanded, as she went closer
to the flapping shoes of her brother. &#8220;Keep
&#8217;em still or you&#8217;ll kick me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;You can try,
but I don&#8217;t believe you can pull me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet could not. Though she tugged and
tugged with both hands at Ted&#8217;s shoes,
bracing her own feet against the end of the
log, she could not stir her brother one inch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wiggle?&#8221; she finally
asked, quite out of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I what?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wiggle a little an&#8217; help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
yourself?&#8221; demanded Janet. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it
all alone! When I pull, you wiggle, an&#8217;
maybe you&#8217;ll get out that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t
wiggle very much. It&#8217;s awful tight in
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Janet took hold of his shoes
and began to pull. At the same time Ted
pushed with his hands backward inside the
log and &#8220;wiggled.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it seemed to be of little use. No more
of Ted&#8217;s legs stuck out from inside the log
than at first.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Quit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Janet. &#8220;Am
I hurting you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but my shoes are coming off!&#8221; answered
Ted. And even as he spoke Janet
pulled so hard that the left shoe came completely
off Ted&#8217;s foot, and the other was
partly off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now I&#8217;ve got to push you,&#8221; decided
Janet, as she dropped the one shoe.
&#8220;If I can&#8217;t pull you I got to push you!
Maybe you&#8217;ll come out the other end with
the fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any fox in here,&#8221; said Teddy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
&#8220;I can see clear through to the other end
and there&#8217;s nothing in the log but me&mdash;I&#8217;m
here all right, an&#8217; I wish I could get out!
Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you! I&#8217;ll push,&#8221; offered Janet.</p>

<p>She was about to push on Ted&#8217;s feet as
they stuck from the log, but he stopped her
with a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it! Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221; he begged.
&#8220;If you push me any farther I&#8217;ll be stuck
worse!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I do then?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go get somebody! Get somebody
to help me out!&#8221; wailed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; cried his sister, and without
trying any more she hurried away through
the woods.</p>

<p>She expected to have to go all the way to
the bungalow to tell her father or mother
about the plight of poor Teddy. But half
way there Janet met two of the lumbermen
and to them she told of her brother&#8217;s plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught in a hollow log, is he?&#8221; asked
one man. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll soon have him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show us where he is, little girl,&#8221; said
the other man, and Janet led the way.</p>

<p>On her way back through the woods with
the lumbermen, the little Curlytop girl half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
feared that when she reached the place
where she had left Ted stuck in the log she
might find his feet being nibbled by the same
fox they had tried to catch. But nothing
like this had happened.</p>

<p>There was the log; there was no sign of
a fox or other wild animal; and Ted&#8217;s feet
were still sticking out, waving slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are, Ted!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
brought back two lumbermen with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get me out! Get me out!&#8221; wailed
Ted, in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon have you out, little man,&#8221;
said one of the lumbermen. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
afraid. We can easily split this log,&#8221; he
added to his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed the other. &#8220;See,&#8221;
he said to Janet, &#8220;this log has a big crack
all the way along it. We&#8217;ll just put in some
wedges and they will make the crack wider.
Then the hole in the log will get bigger and
we can pull your brother out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you can!&#8221; sighed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure we can!&#8221; declared one of the lumbermen.
&#8220;Stay quiet now, little man,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>And Teddy kept very still and quiet inside
the log while on the outside the lumbermen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
cut and drove in with their axes some
wedges of wood.</p>

<p>A wedge, you know, is shaped like the letter
V. The narrow part was put in the
crack, and then the top, or wide part, was
pounded on. As the V&#8217;s went farther and
farther into the crack, the crack opened
wider. This made the hole in the log larger
as the fallen tree trunk was split more
widely open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now I can get out! Now I can get
out!&#8221; joyfully cried Ted, as he felt the log
loosening around him. &#8220;Now I can get
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>And a few seconds later he managed to
wriggle and back out of the log himself,
little the worse because of his adventure.
His face was red, for it was hot inside the
fallen tree, and his clothes were covered
with pieces of brown, rotten wood. But this
easily brushed off.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to go in there?&#8221;
asked one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to drive out a fox so my sister
could catch him,&#8221; answered the Curlytop
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t do that again,&#8221; the
man went on. &#8220;In the first place, no fox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
will ever run into a place unless there is a
way of running out again, and he can run
out quicker than you can run in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing, never try to catch a fox
in your bare hands. They have very sharp
teeth and they&#8217;ll nip you badly. You have
to wear heavy gloves when you handle a fox.
But even if you had driven him out of your
sister&#8217;s end of the log, Teddy, I guess he
would have leaped past Janet so quickly
that it would have looked like a flash of
lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; added the other tree
chopper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it any more,&#8221; Teddy promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t get a crow and we didn&#8217;t get
a fox,&#8221; sighed Janet, rather sadly.</p>

<p>The lumbermen laughed, and one said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You tried to catch two of the hardest
creatures in the world to trap. A fox and
a crow are the slyest of all animals and
birds, and for years so many have tried to
trap and shoot them that they have grown
very wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man who lives near us in
Cresco,&#8221; said Teddy, &#8220;who had a lame, tame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
crow that could stand on one leg and pull a
cork from a bottle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could?&#8221; cried the lumbermen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really pull corks,&#8221; explained Janet.
&#8220;He just made a noise like a cork popping
out of a bottle. But he was cute and he
would stand on one leg so funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he flew away,&#8221; added Teddy. &#8220;And
if we could find him we&#8217;d get ten dollars
reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d look at a crow a long time before I&#8217;d
give ten dollars for one; wouldn&#8217;t you,
Jake?&#8221; asked one man of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sam,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you see this lame, tame crow, will
you please tell us?&#8221; begged Janet. &#8220;&#8217;Cause
we&#8217;d like to take him back to Mr. Jenk and
get the ten dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if we see that crow we&#8217;ll try to
catch him for you,&#8221; promised the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I got the ten dollars I&#8217;d buy my
mother a new diamond locket in place of the
one I lost for her,&#8221; went on Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; asked one of the men,
for they took a kindly interest in the children.
Then Janet told how the ornament
was lost the day she and her brother were
playing house with Trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;That was too bad,&#8221; remarked Jake.
And then, as the children went back home
with the crow trap in which they had caught
nothing, one lumberman said to the other:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there isn&#8217;t one chance in a hundred
of finding that lame, tame crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; agreed the other.
&#8220;Nor of finding that diamond locket,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course those at the bungalow must be
told of what had happened to Ted in the
hollow log, and he was warned not to try
such a dangerous thing again.</p>

<p>Many times the Curlytops visited the
general store, which was now running well
under the direction of Mr. Martin. The
lumbermen and their families bought their
supplies at the store, and so did some of the
near-by farmers. Once Silas Armstrong,
on whose load of hay Trouble had gone to
sleep, came to buy groceries, and he had a
pleasant chat with the Curlytops.</p>

<p>It was about a week after Ted&#8217;s adventure
in the hollow log that something else
happened to him. Some of the lumbermen
had been sent to a distant part of the woods
to build a chute, or slide, for the logs to shoot
down into the river. Then a slight accident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
occurred to the sawmill machinery and the
foreman of it wanted all the help he could
get to mend the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Jake and Sam were here,&#8221; said
the foreman, as he and all the other men
worked hard to mend the broken machinery.
&#8220;But they&#8217;re away over by the new chute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go after them and tell them to come
here,&#8221; offered Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you? All right, young Curlytop!&#8221;
exclaimed the foreman. &#8220;Do you know the
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; answered Ted, quite confident.</p>

<p>If Mr. Martin had been there or in the
store, which was not far from the mill, he
might not have let Teddy go. But the father
of the Curlytops was off in another part of
the forest seeing about something connected
with the business. And Ted never asked his
mother if he might go. He just went.</p>

<p>Off he started through the woods to go to
the distant place where Jake and Sam&mdash;the
two men who had gotten him out of the log&mdash;were
working on the chute.</p>

<p>At first the path through the woods was
very plain, and Ted had no trouble. But
after a while the trail became fainter and
more than once the Curlytop boy stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and looked about him, listening for the
sound of chopping axes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to hear any,&#8221; he murmured;
&#8220;but I&#8217;m sure this is the right
path.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not, and the farther Ted wandered
the more distant he got from the place
where the men were working. Deeper he
went into the forest until at last he had to
stop and give up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess I&#8217;m lost!&#8221; murmured Ted.
His heart began to beat strangely. It was
a fearful feeling to be alone in the woods.
And that is what had happened to poor
Teddy.</p>

<small>A STRANGE CRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jake</span> and Sam, who had been sent to the
distant part of the woods to build the long
chute, of course knew nothing of Teddy
having been sent to call them back to help
mend the broken machinery in the sawmill.
Meanwhile the foreman and his &#8220;gang&#8221; did
the best they could without the two missing
ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why Jake and Sam didn&#8217;t
hurry back here to help us,&#8221; said one lumberman.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed another. &#8220;It would
have been a lot easier if they had been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the foreman looked up, after
the hardest part of the work had been finished,
and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There come Jake and Sam now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely enough, the chute builders were
approaching.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Well, you took your own time getting
here,&#8221; said the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Took our own time? What do you
mean?&#8221; asked Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell us to stay in the woods
and finish making that new chute to send
the logs down to the river?&#8221; asked Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but a while ago I sent the Curlytop
boy to tell you to hurry back here and help
us. We had an accident in the sawmill, but
it&#8217;s all fixed now. Why didn&#8217;t you two
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because no one told us to,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see Teddy?&#8221; asked the foreman,
whose name was Tod Everett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a sign of him,&#8221; answered Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Tod. &#8220;He must have
wandered off&mdash;maybe he went fishing&mdash;and
forgot to tell you. But he&#8217;s a pretty good
boy for his age. I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d do a
thing like forgetting on purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think happened?&#8221; asked
Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he didn&#8217;t know in what part
of the woods to look for you, though he was
sure he knew his way,&#8221; said the foreman.
&#8220;But maybe his mother saw him going and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
called him back. I&#8217;d better go over to the
house and find out. It&#8217;s getting late and
will soon be dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tod Everett, the foreman, tried not to
let his voice sound anxious as he asked Mrs.
Martin:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Teddy around?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he over at
the mill with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was there,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But we
had an accident and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An accident!&#8221; cried Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be worried! It was just that one
of the saws broke. No one was hurt, and
Teddy wasn&#8217;t even around when it happened.
But I needed Jake and Sam to help
the other men, and I was going to send one
of the men for them, over where they were
building a chute, when Teddy offered to go.
He said he knew the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose he does,&#8221; agreed Mrs.
Martin. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t he go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he had until Jake and Sam
came back just now and said they hadn&#8217;t
seen him,&#8221; went on the foreman. &#8220;I thought
maybe you saw him starting off and called
him back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin. &#8220;I am
afraid something may have happened to
him,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing that could happen would
be that he might get on the wrong trail and
wander off a little bit,&#8221; said Tod. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
the gang out and we&#8217;ll soon find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Martin arrived,
and though he was worried when told about
the absence of Teddy, he believed that the
missing Curlytop lad would shortly be
found.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it will soon be night!&#8221; his wife
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find him before then,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A searching party was quickly organized,
two of them, in fact, one to go one way and
the second another way. And as the shadows
began to get longer, showing that darkness
was on its way, the lumbermen, led by Mr.
Martin, started off into the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do hope they find Teddy before it
gets dark!&#8221; sighed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; murmured her mother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile perhaps we had better find out
what happened to Teddy.</p>

<p>As I have told you, he thought he surely
knew the way to the place where Jake and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Sam were working on the new lumber chute.
He had been there before once or twice.
But as he walked along and along the path
he saw it growing fainter and fainter, showing
that it was not much used.</p>

<p>And then Teddy knew that he was lost!</p>

<p>But he was a brave little fellow, and,
brushing his curly hair back from his eyes,
he picked up a stout stick for a club and
walked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d better go back home,&#8221; he
said to himself.</p>

<p>He turned about, and thought he started
straight back over the way he came. But if
you have ever been in the deep woods, you
know how much one tree looks like another
and that all the bushes seem the same. So
Teddy could not tell when he had turned
completely around to go back.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he turned only partly
around and, instead of heading for the bungalow,
he was wandering away from it
almost as much as when he started straight
away to get the lumbermen.</p>

<p>For a time Teddy tramped on, quite sure
he was going back to the bungalow. He was
a little disappointed that he had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
able to find the lumbermen to tell them to
go back and help at the sawmill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Mr. Everett will think I&#8217;m not
much good,&#8221; mused Ted. &#8220;If I couldn&#8217;t do
a little errand like that he won&#8217;t want me to
do things for him again. It&#8217;s too bad! But
I didn&#8217;t think it was so easy to get lost in
the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy was more lost than he realized, and
he became aware of this when he saw that it
was growing dusky. The sun was beginning
to set, and though it was still light out in
the open, in the fields and meadows, the
woods had already begun to darken, as the
dying rays of the sun could not get between
the trees.</p>

<p>After having walked, as he thought, many
miles, though it was very likely not more
than two, Teddy became very tired and a
little frightened.</p>

<p>Then he happened to think of something
an older boy had told him to do when lost in
the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you think you&#8217;re lost in the woods,
don&#8217;t rush about, but sit down and wait for
a while. Help may come. And, anyhow,
sit down for a while until you get quiet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
aren&#8217;t so excited. You can&#8217;t think well
when you&#8217;re excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Teddy was certainly excited now. I
suppose you would have been that way yourself
if you were lost and alone in the woods
as was the Curlytop boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit down and think!&#8221; decided Teddy.</p>

<p>He did this, waiting and hoping that some
one might happen along to lead him back
to camp, which he could not find by himself.
But as he sat there and the shadows grew
longer, he began to worry and to think that
he had better be doing something for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call,&#8221; decided Teddy, and he sent
out loud shouts.</p>

<p>Now, as it happened, he did not begin to
yell for help until after Jake and Sam had
left their working place in the woods and
were on their way home. Otherwise the
lumbermen might have heard the boy&#8217;s
cries. But chance so had it that when he
was calling they were tramping through the
underbrush too far away to hear him.</p>

<p>Also Teddy&#8217;s shouts did not echo through
the woods at the time the searching parties
started out, for not until Jake and Sam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
reached camp did it become known that the
Curlytop lad was lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! Help! Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again and again Teddy cried this, but
the only answers were the echoes from the
woods and hills that now were in deeper
shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; thought the boy. &#8220;Sitting
still and shouting isn&#8217;t going to do any
good. I&#8217;m going to walk along.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this is where Teddy made a mistake.
He should have remained in one place, and
then the searchers who soon started out
might have found him. But when he walked
on again, he wandered farther and farther
away from them.</p>

<p>Teddy was in a sore plight. He was tired
and hungry and lost. That was too much
for one small boy. Any one of them was
trouble enough all alone, but when the three
came together&mdash;well, it was terrible, so
Teddy thought, and I believe you will agree
with him.</p>

<p>Still he was not going to give up, sit down,
and cry about it. As long as there was a
little light in the woods he would tramp on,
hoping he might, somehow, wander back to
the bungalow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>But as it grew darker and darker, and
Teddy thought he saw strange sights and
shadows in the woods, his heart beat very
fast. Once he thought he saw a great bear
thrusting out a hairy paw toward him, and
he started to run. But he turned back in
time to see that it was only a waving tree
branch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have got to get home! I just have to!&#8221;
half-sobbed Teddy. On he ran again. It
was so dark now that he could not see the
ground very well, and his foot caught in a
trailing vine, tripping him so that he fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>But the forest ground was covered with
a thick coating of fallen leaves of other
years, and these made a soft cushion on
which he had fallen.</p>

<p>Up he rose again, more desperate than
before. He clenched his hands tightly, his
hunger now forgotten and his only idea
being to rush away out of the darkness, back
to the light and cheerfulness of the bungalow.</p>

<p>For a moment Teddy was dazed. Then,
as his mind cleared, he looked through the
trees and caught a glimpse of a light. At
first he thought it was a campfire, but soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
saw it was only the last fading rays of the
red sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go that way&mdash;toward the sun,&#8221; decided
Teddy.</p>

<p>On and on he stumbled. Once, before he
knew it, he had walked into a swampy place
in the woods, and his feet got wet. But this
was a small matter now. His heart thumped
under his little jacket, and he had to close
his teeth hard to keep from screaming out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mustn&#8217;t be a coward! I mustn&#8217;t
be a coward!&#8221; thought Teddy.</p>

<p>On and on he went. The red sunset died
away. The woods were now very dark.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the gloom, came a
strange cry. It was a high, shrill wail, and
at first Teddy thought some one had called
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am! Here I am!&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Then, as the strange, wailing cry sounded
again, Teddy knew it was no person calling.</p>

<p>It was some animal!</p>

<small>THE LONELY CABIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Martin</span> was as brave as any boy
of his age could be. But he was like nearly
all other boys. When he heard or saw something
about which he did not know he became
alarmed.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had seen an elephant or a
tiger really coming toward him in the woods,
he might not have been half as frightened
as he was at that strange cry from some
unknown animal. For seeing a lion, a tiger,
or an elephant lets you know at once what
you have to expect. And it may be that by
running, dodging and hiding you can get
away from the beasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it that&#8217;s howling at me?&#8221;
thought Ted.</p>

<p>He did not know, and there was none
present to tell him.</p>

<p>That was the worst of it&mdash;not knowing
what animal was trailing after him&mdash;stalking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
him up in the trees, maybe&mdash;following
him!</p>

<p>Teddy had stopped after calling out that
he was there, thinking it was some person
who had been sent to rescue him. But after
a moment, when he knew that it was some
animal, the boy prepared to run on again.
Though where he would go in the darkness,
and how he could save himself from the
beast, he did not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to stay here to be
jumped on and clawed and bitten!&#8221; thought
the Curlytop lad.</p>

<p>There flashed through his mind all the
stories he had ever read or heard about wild
beasts in the woods at night. For a few
seconds Ted thought the worst&mdash;that it
might be a lion or a tiger.</p>

<p>Then his better sense came to his aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;How silly I am!&#8221; he exclaimed to himself,
as he started off again in the darkness.
&#8220;Of course there aren&#8217;t any lions or tigers
here. They live only in hot countries in the
jungle. The only wild animals around here
that might hurt me are bears, foxes and&mdash;bobcats!&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy almost forgot about this last-named
beast. But he had heard the lumbermen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
talking about it only the other day.
Bears, the wood-choppers had said, were
very scarce and hard even for a hunter to
find, so Ted knew he need not worry about
them. He, himself, had seen a fox, and had
noted how the brown creature with the big
tail had so quickly run away.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fox won&#8217;t fight unless you corner
him,&#8221; thought Teddy; &#8220;and I&#8217;m not going
to corner this one! Besides, a fox doesn&#8217;t
climb a tree, and this animal is up in the
trees overhead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew this, because he had heard the
branches rustling as the animal sent out
its strange cry.</p>

<p>There was only one thing left that the
beast could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bobcat!&#8221; whispered Ted to himself.</p>

<p>And as he heard again the strange, wailing
cry of the beast, he felt sure he had
guessed right.</p>

<p>&#8220;They claw terrible, and bite!&#8221; thought
Ted, with a shiver of fear, for he had heard
the lumbermen talking about the bobcat, or
lynx, which is another name for it. &#8220;But
maybe it can&#8217;t find me,&#8221; thought the Curlytop
boy hopefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>He wished that it was daylight, and then
he wished that he had his electric pocket
flash lamp with him, so that he might see
which way to go. But he had to make the
best of it, and so he slipped along as well
as he could, gliding amid the trees and
bushes of the dark forest.</p>

<p>He bumped into stumps and the trunks
of trees. His feet became entangled in
vines and, tripping, he fell. He stepped into
mud puddles of cold water. All in all, poor
Ted was quite miserable.</p>

<p>Now and then he heard a rustling in the
tree branches overhead, and he felt sure the
bobcat was following him, waiting for a
chance to drop down on him and bite or
scratch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to yell!&#8221; decided Teddy.
&#8220;Maybe that will scare that bobcat.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yell he did as loudly as he could.
He not only wanted to scare away the bobcat,
if one was really chasing him in the
tree tops, but Ted also wanted to let those
who might be searching for him, know
where he was.</p>

<p>Again and again Ted cried, sending his
ringing voice out in the darkness of the
forest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Had those who were searching for him
only been near enough they would surely
have heard him and come to his rescue.
There were two rescue parties out, as I have
told you. Mr. Martin led one and Tod Everett,
the foreman of the lumber gang, led
the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin remained at home in the
bungalow with Janet, Trouble and Lucy.
They were much frightened and worried,
and more than once Janet would listen for
any sound outside the cabin and then she
would ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll find Teddy,
Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they will,&#8221; would be the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; Janet would ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, soon now,&#8221; Mrs. Martin would reply.
But as the hours passed and the rescuers
did not come back with the missing
little boy, Mrs. Martin became more and
more worried, though she did not say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Po&#8217; honey lamb!&#8221; mused Lucy, as she
rocked Trouble to and fro to keep him
asleep, for he was restless. &#8220;I done wisht
he&#8217;d come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; murmured Janet. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
her mother said she had better go to bed
and rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll not sleep,&#8221; Janet answered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay awake all night&mdash;or until
Teddy comes home.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, even worry about her beloved
brother could not long keep Janet awake,
and soon her eyes were closed, as were
Trouble&#8217;s. Then Mrs. Martin and Lucy sat
up, listening and hoping.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin had been very sure he or the
other searchers would soon find Teddy. He
thought the boy had merely taken the wrong
path through the woods and was wandering
about, not far from the bungalow.</p>

<p>But the truth of it was that Teddy had
gone farther than even he realized, and
much farther than his father thought a
small boy could walk in the time he was
gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing that&#8217;s against us,&#8221; said
one of the lumbermen, &#8220;is that it&#8217;s so dark.
There&#8217;s any number of little hollows and
ravines that the boy could be in and we&#8217;d
miss him even in daylight. And after dark
it&#8217;s harder yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is,&#8221; said Mr. Martin. &#8220;But
I think he&#8217;ll hear us shouting and answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
us. Besides the moon will be up pretty
soon, and it won&#8217;t be so dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as for the shouts, Ted did not hear
those of the rescuers, and they did not hear
his cries as he yelled to drive away the bobcat,
if such it was that was trailing him.
So the search was kept up.</p>

<p>As for Ted, he wandered on and on, really
going farther away from the bungalow and
his friends instead of toward them.</p>

<p>The boy listened after he had shouted to
drive away, as he hoped, the strange wailing
beast. Then, as he did not hear any sound
in the tree tops and that strange cry did
not again make him shiver, he took heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve scared him away,&#8221; thought
Teddy.</p>

<p>He started off again in the darkness as
best he could. But he had not taken many
steps before that same cry welled forth
again, sending the shivers up and down poor
Ted&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You old beast!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you jump down and be done with it! I&#8217;ll
hit you with a club if you do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted firmly grasped the piece of tree
branch he had picked up and waited. He
stood under a tree, and he thought if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
bobcat did leap down the tree would be a
good thing to dodge behind.</p>

<p>Then, just as Mr. Martin had told those
in his party would happen, the moon rose.
Or, rather, it came out from behind some
clouds that, earlier in the evening, had hidden
the silver disk. The woods were now
much lighter, and for this Ted was glad,
even though the moon did cast strange shadows.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he looked up into the tree
from which the strange animal seemed last
to have cried, Ted saw two green and gleaming
eyes. The moon shone on them.</p>

<p>And then a voice seemed to call:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who! Who! Whoo-oo-oo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly Ted burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s only an owl!&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;It was an owl that was following me
through the woods. But I didn&#8217;t know owls
cried like a bobcat. I thought they only
made a sound like just now&mdash;&#8216;who!&#8217; I&#8217;m
glad it&#8217;s only an owl!&#8221;</p>

<p>The owl, for such it was, flew away. Ted
saw it go, but he could not hear the flapping
wings, for an owl flies on silent pinions, its
wings being covered with such soft feathers
as to make scarcely a sound. In this way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
an owl can fly close to the creature it wishes
to catch without being heard.</p>

<p>Ted laughed again as the owl hooted and
vanished in the night. The boy felt better
now, and he was beginning to wonder if he
would have to spend the night alone in the
forest when, suddenly, that same strange
cry sounded again. This time so near at
hand&mdash;in a tree directly over Teddy&#8217;s head&mdash;that
the boy jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the owl after all!&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;It must be the bobcat still after me!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a rustling in the leaves of the
tree, and Ted dodged behind the trunk of
the one he had picked out as a refuge. Then
as the moon became a bit brighter, for more
clouds passed from it, the boy caught sight
of two other eyes, gleaming red and green
as they reflected the shine of the moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s looking right at me!&#8221; thought Ted,
for, indeed, the eyes seemed to stare at him.
&#8220;Come on down here and I&#8217;ll hit you with
this club!&#8221; cried the boy boldly.</p>

<p>However the bobcat&mdash;and by a glimpse
he had of the beast Ted was sure it was a
lynx&mdash;did not accept the invitation to come
down and be clubbed. The animal snarled
again and moved out on the limb over Ted&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
head so the boy had a good view of it. Then
he saw more clearly what it was&mdash;an animal
like a cat, only three times as large, and
with curious tufts of fur on its ears. The
lynx is about the only animal that has ear
tassels.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ted decided on a bold move. If
the bobcat would not come down to be
clubbed, the boy would not exactly climb up
the tree to hit it&mdash;that would be dangerous
indeed&mdash;but Ted could throw his club at
the beast.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221; decided the boy.</p>

<p>Ted was a good ball player for a boy of
his age, and could throw straight. He had
often gone after chestnuts in the woods, and
had thrown clubs up into the trees to bring
down a shower of brown nuts.</p>

<p>Now he stepped back until he saw that he
had a clear aim for the bobcat on a limb
out over his head. Ted began to swing his
club back and forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thrown a club farther than this!&#8221;
thought Ted.</p>

<p>He drew back his arm and let fly the
heavy piece of wood. It went straight for
the bobcat, and, somewhat to Ted&#8217;s surprise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
it struck the animal on the nose, its most
tender spot.</p>

<p>Instantly it felt the blow of the club on
its nose, the lynx sent out a loud howl. Then
it snarled and began tearing at the branch
with its sharp claws, so that it sent down
a shower of bark on Ted.</p>

<p>Then, with another howl, as it rubbed its
sore nose between its paws, the lynx turned
as if to run down the tree trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming after me!&#8221; thought Ted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve made him good and mad and he&#8217;s
coming after me. I&#8217;d better run!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before this the boy had &#8220;invited&#8221; the
lynx to come down and be clubbed. But
now that he actually saw the beast coming
after him, as he thought, Ted could not
stand it. Turning, he ran away.</p>

<p>The moon now gave better light than at
first, and Ted could see to keep out of the
way of trees and bushes. Thus he made
better speed.</p>

<p>On and on he ran, not stopping to listen
to learn if the lynx were coming after him.
He stepped into puddles, but his feet were
wet anyhow, and he no longer minded this.
Suddenly he saw before him a well made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
path through the trees&mdash;a path that seemed
to have been often used.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe this is the way home!&#8221; thought
Ted. &#8220;I hope it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment before turning
into this path. He listened. No longer did
he hear the rustling in the tree branches
overhead, showing that the lynx was following
him. Nor did he hear that strange,
wailing cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I drove him away when I hit
him on the nose!&#8221; thought Ted.</p>

<p>He started down the path, running as fast
as he could. Then, a little later, he saw
that it did not lead to the bungalow at
Mount Major. Instead it led to a little
clearing, and in the midst of this place,
where the trees were cut down, stood a
lonely cabin.</p>

<p>Who lived there? Did anyone? Would
it be best for Ted to knock and ask to be
taken in for the night?</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>THE TRICK CROW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Ted was standing on the edge of
the clearing looking at the light gleaming
from the lonely cabin and wondering
whether or not he should go up to it and ask
for shelter, the search for him was going
on in another part of the woods.</p>

<p>As it grew darker and darker and got
later and later, even Mr. Martin began to
give up hope of finding Ted that night. And
some of the men in the party led by the
foreman, Tod Everett, spoke out and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use going on any farther.
The boy&#8217;s probably asleep in some hollow
tree or covered with leaves to keep himself
warm in some ravine. We might as well
give up until daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the foreman would not give up unless
Mr. Martin asked him to, and so he decided
to circle around and meet the boy&#8217;s father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The two searching parties had separated,
one going one way and one another, and
at times they were quite far apart. But as
the night grew darker the two bands of men
drew near together until at last Tod was
able to call to Mr. Martin, asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say? Shall we keep on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted&#8217;s father considered. He knew that
the men were tired, and yet he did not want
to go back to the bungalow and have his
wife meet him to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be better to keep on searching
even all night.</p>

<p>But one of the lumbermen had an idea
which in the end turned out to be a very
good one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not go back to the bungalow and
see if there is any news?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;news?&#8221; asked the
foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean maybe the boy has wandered
back there himself, or maybe some one has
telephoned in that they have him at their
farm. There&#8217;s lots of telephones around
this part of the country. Nearly every farmer
has one, and I know two trappers who
have telephones and wireless sets, too. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
maybe some of them have picked up Ted,
or he may have wandered to their shacks.
And there&#8217;s a telephone in the store. I guess
Ted could tell who he was and where he was
from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he could do that!&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Martin. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good plan, Jake. We&#8217;ll
go back and see if there is any news. As
you say, Ted may be back there now, or
some one may have telephoned in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now we shall see what Ted himself did.
For a few moments he stood staring at the
lonely cabin from which gleamed a cheerful
light. The boy listened.</p>

<p>No longer did the owl hoot. No longer
did he hear the weird cry of the bobcat or
the noise made as the creature crept along
in the tree tops. And from the cabin came
not a sound at first. There was only the
cheerful light.</p>

<p>Then suddenly from a window of the
cabin&mdash;a window that was open, as Ted
could tell by the flapping curtain&mdash;there
sounded a voice speaking. And to Ted&#8217;s
amazement the voice said in rather strange,
loud tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is station Q Q Z. The next number
on our radio program will be selections by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the Harmony Band. Just a moment
please!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted could scarcely believe his ears. One
moment to be hooted at by an owl and chased
by a bobcat in the midst of dark and lonesome
woods. The next minute to come upon
a lighted cabin and hear from it the loud
speaker of a wireless outfit!</p>

<p>For it was radio music that a moment
later sounded on Ted&#8217;s ear&mdash;sweet melodious
strains floating out into the darkness,
brought to that lonely cabin by the mysterious
electric waves and sent out by means
of light bulbs and a loud speaker.</p>

<p>It was wonderful!</p>

<p>For a moment Ted stood there listening.
He knew the Harmony Band. Many a time
he had listened to it over his father&#8217;s wireless
set at home when the musical organization
played at the Q Q Z station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Ted aloud, as the music
welled out on the night. &#8220;I&#8217;m safe now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly he hurried across the clearing
toward the lighted cabin. The music was
louder and plainer as he drew near. It was
even so loud that when he knocked on the
door his tapping was not heard. Realizing
this, and not wanting to wait until the music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
stopped, Ted opened the door and walked
in.</p>

<p>He found himself within a well-furnished
bungalow, somewhat like the one at Mount
Major, only not so large. In the main room
was a man and his wife and a boy about
Ted&#8217;s age. And this boy was leaning over
the radio instrument set in one corner on a
table, making some adjustments to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tune it down a little, so it isn&#8217;t so loud,&#8221;
said the boy&#8217;s mother, as Ted entered.</p>

<p>As the boy turned the knob of the variable
condenser, softening the musical sounds
from the black mouth of the loud-speaker
horn, they all turned and looked at Ted.</p>

<p>He met their gaze smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed the man, in some surprise,
though his voice was friendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you get in?&#8221; asked the boy at the
radio instrument. Then he turned the
switch and cut off the battery power from
one of the lights so that the music no longer
sounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came&mdash;I came in the door,&#8221; said Ted.
&#8220;I knocked, but I guess you didn&#8217;t hear
me &#8217;cause the music was going.&#8221; And then,
like the &#8220;radio bug&#8221; he was fast becoming,
Ted eagerly asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Do you get any other stations besides
Q Q Z?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do!&#8221; answered the other boy,
and in a moment, though hardly a dozen
words had been spoken, the two lads were
firm friends&mdash;just because of their interest
in radio.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a set at home,&#8221; went on Ted,
&#8220;but we haven&#8217;t any loud speaker yet. I
want dad to get one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live around here?&#8221; asked the
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember you,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m over at Mount Major. My father
has charge of the store at the sawmill,&#8221; explained
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tod Everett&#8217;s outfit!&#8221; exclaimed
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s the foreman,&#8221; went on Ted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost!&#8221; cried the other boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I started out this afternoon to
bring back two of the men who were building
a lumber chute. There was an accident
at the mill and Mr. Everett needed all the
hands to fix it. But I couldn&#8217;t find Jake
and Sam and I got lost, and a bobcat chased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
me, but I hit him on the nose with a club
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you hit a bobcat
with a club!&#8221; exclaimed the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I did. But I guess it was sort of
an accident,&#8221; admitted Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been lost since early afternoon!&#8221;
cried the boy. &#8220;You must be terribly
hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; confessed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you poor boy!&#8221; murmured the woman.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had supper, but I can get you
something. Why, your folks must be worried
to death about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they are,&#8221; admitted Ted.
&#8220;&#8217;Course, I&#8217;ve been lost before. But not like
this. If I could send word to the bungalow
they&#8217;d know I am all right now. But you
can&#8217;t send word over your wireless,&#8221; he
added to the boy. &#8220;You only have a receiving
set, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m not allowed to send.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can telephone in the regular
way,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Is there a telephone
in your place?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is in the store,&#8221; Ted answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call up your family and let &#8217;em
know you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; the man offered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
&#8220;Now if you go with my wife she&#8217;ll get you
something to eat,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>You may be sure Ted was only too glad
to go. Into the kitchen, while food was being
set out, the boy came from the sitting
room to help his mother. Ted learned that
the family was named Brixton, and that the
boy was called Harry.</p>

<p>Now that he was taken in and cared for,
Ted began to know just how hungry he was,
and he was so busy putting the food in the
place where it ought to go&mdash;in his mouth
and stomach&mdash;that he hardly heard Mr.
Brixton telephoning to the store.</p>

<p>It did not take long to be connected with
Mount Major, and Mrs. Martin answered
the telephone, for her husband and the men
had not yet gotten back.</p>

<p>The way of it was this. Mrs. Martin was
sitting out in front of the bungalow with
Lucy, for the night was warm. Janet and
Trouble were in bed asleep, and the faithful
colored maid was trying to comfort Mrs.
Martin, telling her that Teddy would surely
be found soon.</p>

<p>Then the telephone in the store rang very
hard. There was no one to answer it, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the place was closed at night. However,
Mrs. Martin heard the jingling bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe that means something,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And you can imagine how happy she was
when Mr. Brixton&#8217;s voice sounded over the
wire, telling her the lost boy had been found
and was, even then, in his cabin eating a late
supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you sure it&#8217;s my Teddy?&#8221; asked
the now happy mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; answered Mr. Brixton.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll let him talk to you himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And soon Teddy and his mother were exchanging
joyful words. Briefly Teddy told
what had happened to him. Then Mr. Brixton,
who had come to live in the cabin in the
wood for his summer vacation, informed
Mrs. Martin just how his place could be
reached by the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband and all the men are out in
the woods now looking for Teddy,&#8221; said
Mrs. Martin. &#8220;I can&#8217;t drive the auto over,
as I don&#8217;t want to leave my other two children
here. But as soon as my husband
comes back I&#8217;ll send him after Teddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No hurry at all,&#8221; said Mr. Brixton, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
a laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be glad to keep him all
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted was happy now. He was safe with
his new friends, he had had a good supper,
and his mother, at least, knew where he was.
Now he could listen to the wireless music
with a glad heart.</p>

<p>And that is what he and Harry did. When
the second supper had been cleared away&mdash;though,
truth to tell Ted did not leave much
in the way of food on the table&mdash;the two
boys &#8220;fussed&#8221; over the radio instrument,
&#8220;picking up&#8221; distant stations.</p>

<p>It was not long after Mrs. Martin had
received the joyful news of Ted&#8217;s safety
over the telephone that her husband and the
other searchers came back to Mount Major.
The first thing Mr. Martin asked was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very best!&#8221; cried his wife, happily.
&#8220;Teddy&#8217;s in the woods cabin of Mr. Brixton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where his place is!&#8221; said Tod
Everett. &#8220;My, but I&#8217;m glad that boy&#8217;s
found!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; murmured Mr. Martin, and
all the lumbermen said the same thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to speak about it before,&#8221;
went on the foreman to Mr. Martin. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
there are wildcats in the woods&mdash;lynx, you
know. I was afraid some of them might
have scared the boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they didn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the father.</p>

<p>But if Ted had not exactly been frightened
by the bobcat, he was so near to it
that, as Tod Everett said later, &#8220;they wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
no fun in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time Mr. Martin and the foreman
were on their way in the automobile
to Mr. Brixton&#8217;s cabin, and there Ted was
found, joyfully listening to music caught by
the wireless instrument which worked just
as well, and perhaps better, in the lonely
woods than it does in your city home, if
you live in the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ted, you had quite an adventure!&#8221;
his father greeted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a lot of &#8217;em!&#8221; replied Ted. Then
he told some of the things that had happened
to him, while the others wondered at
his pluck and spirit.</p>

<p>Thanking the kind Brixton family for
their care of Ted, Mr. Martin was soon on
his homeward way with the lost boy, and a
little later there was a joyful reunion in the
bungalow at Mount Major.</p>

<p>Janet awakened, having had a bad dream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and her first question was a sleepy inquiry
if her brother had come home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, he&#8217;s here, and safe,&#8221; whispered
her mother.</p>

<p>Then Janet turned over with a contented
sigh and went sound asleep again. Trouble
did not awaken, and it was not until morning
that he knew the whole story of Ted
being lost and found.</p>

<p>You may be sure Ted was warned not to
get lost again, and of course he said he would
not. The foreman could not forgive himself
for having let the Curlytop boy go on the
errand to summon the two men from the
log chute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was all right,&#8221; said Mr. Martin.
&#8220;Ted was just as likely to have gotten lost
playing out in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ted promised to be more careful after
this.</p>

<p>Trouble was soon himself again after his
little illness, and as a sort of celebration he
and the Curlytops went one day for another
picnic in the woods, taking their lunch with
them. They were warned not to, and promised
they wouldn&#8217;t, go far away.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet were making a playhouse
near an old stump, and Trouble had wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
off a short distance to look for pretty
stones. Suddenly the little fellow came
toddling back in a hurry, to cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s knockin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knocking? What do you mean,
Trouble?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; ordered William, holding up
one hand as he had seen his mother do.</p>

<p>To the ears of Ted and Janet came a rat-at-at-tat-tat!
sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear &#8217;em knockin!&#8221; whispered Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what that is,&#8221; declared Ted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a woodpecker picking holes in a tree so
he can get the worms and bugs. It&#8217;s a woodpecker
knocking, that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he want to come into our playhouse?&#8221;
asked Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Janet.
She looked up in the trees overhead, to see
if she could find the tapping woodpecker,
then suddenly, as she caught sight of another
bird, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Ted! The tame crow! There&#8217;s
Mr. Jenk&#8217;s lame, trick crow!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE SAWDUST FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy</span> was piling some sticks up against
the stump, to make it look more like a playhouse.
But as he heard his sister call out
about the lame, tame crow, the Curlytop
boy dropped the sticks and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he? Show him to me and I&#8217;ll
catch him and get the ten dollars. I&#8217;ll give
you half! Where is he, Janet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up there!&#8221; and his sister pointed amid
the trees.</p>

<p>Ted came and stood beside her until he
could look up along her outstretched arm,
hand and finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you playin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Trouble, who
had come back, tired of looking for pretty
stones. &#8220;I wants play game!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t any game,&#8221; explained Janet.
&#8220;I&#8217;m showing Teddy where Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow
is&mdash;the lame, tame crow. Do you see him,
Ted?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p class="caption">AN INSTANT LATER HE SPREAD OUT HIS<br /> WINGS AND SOARED
AWAY.<br />


&#8220;The Curlytops in the Woods.&#8221;  <span class="gap">    Page <a href="#Page_199">199</a></span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;Yes, I see a crow,&#8221; he answered a moment
later. &#8220;But how do you know he is
Mr. Jenk&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because! Look how he stands!&#8221; answered
Janet.</p>

<p>As she spoke the woodpecker tapped
again.</p>

<p>Tap! Tap! Tappity-tap-tap! Rat-a-tat!
went the hard bill of the woodpecker
on the hollow limb of a tree. It was like a
distant little drum.</p>

<p>And as surely as Ted and Janet looked,
to say nothing of Trouble peering up into
the trees&mdash;as surely as the children looked,
when the sound of the woodpecker&#8217;s bill
echoed through the woods, the crow stood on
one leg. At least it seemed so to the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;He&#8217;s
standing on one leg just like Mr. Jenk&#8217;s
crow used to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has the other leg sticking out,&#8221;
added Ted. &#8220;Janet, I believe this is the
tame crow!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;But how did
it ever get away up here in the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered his sister.</p>

<p>The woodpecker kept on tapping, for that
was his way of getting something to eat&mdash;bugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and worms that he pulled out of holes
he drilled in the rotten wood of the tree.
The woodpecker cared nothing about the
crow.</p>

<p>And as the woodpecker tapped the crow
still stood on one leg, with the other, as
nearly as the children could see, stuck out to
one side, stiff and straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;That surely is Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow!&#8221; declared
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d only pop like a cork coming from
a bottle we&#8217;d be certain,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;Then
I&#8217;d get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you get him?&#8221; Janet wanted
to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb the tree!&#8221; cried Teddy. &#8220;I
can do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started toward the tree, but just then
Janet cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! I think he&#8217;s going to pop!&#8221; She
meant that the crow might be going to imitate
the pulling of a cork from a bottle.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got his mouth open,&#8221; went on Janet.</p>

<p>Teddy, too, saw this, and he was beginning
to make very sure that it was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s
crow when suddenly, as the black bird had
his mouth open, there sounded at some distance
in the woods the cry of:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was another crow hoarsely calling, and
as the noise came to the crow that was standing
on one leg, he gave forth an answering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; cried Janet as she heard this.
&#8220;He was just going to pop the cork when
that other crow hollered and made him holler.
But I&#8217;m sure it was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s lame,
tame crow, Ted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, too. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll go up the
tree and get him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Why Teddy thought he could climb a tree
and catch the crow I can&#8217;t tell you. Certainly
if the boy had been a bit older, or if
he had stopped to think, he would have
known that a bird that can fly and hop cannot
be caught by some one climbing a tree
after it.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s just what happened to Teddy.
No sooner did he start to climb the tree than
again the cawing sounded distantly in the
woods. It was answered by the crow who
was still standing on one leg. And then this
black bird that the Curlytops were watching
suddenly put both claws down on the
limb.</p>

<p>An instant later he spread out his wings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
and soared away, flying off through the
trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; sighed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I can watch where he goes!&#8221;
cried her brother.</p>

<p>He ran forward through the trees, but a
crow can fly much faster than a small boy
can run&mdash;or even a large boy for that matter&mdash;and
soon the black bird was lost to
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, maybe he&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; said
Janet, trying to comfort her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he does,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to get that ten dollars. I&#8217;m sure it was Mr.
Jenk&#8217;s crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they told their father and
mother about it Mr. and Mrs. Martin only
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be the same crow that got
away from our neighbor, Mr. Jenk,&#8221; Mr.
Martin said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it would fly
up this far, though of course a crow that
wasn&#8217;t lame could fly many miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he stood on one leg, just like Mr.
Jenk&#8217;s tame crow used to when we snapped
our fingers, or made a tapping sound,&#8221; explained
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, birds often stand on one leg,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
his father. &#8220;And so do chickens. Lots of
times I&#8217;ve seen one of our roosters stand on
one leg with the other drawn up under his
feathers to keep warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it wasn&#8217;t Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow,
but it looked like him and it acted like him,&#8221;
decided Janet.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it. The
crow, whatever crow it might be, had flown
away and might never be seen again. The
Curlytops were a bit sad and disappointed
for a while, but soon got over this feeling
as there were so many things to do in the
woods and so much fun to have in the lumber
camp.</p>

<p>Ted had gotten all over his scare of being
lost in the woods and of being followed by
the bobcat. In fact he wanted to start out
to try to hunt the lynx.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could easy catch him,&#8221; he said to his
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think so,&#8221; said Mr. Martin,
with a smile. &#8220;A lynx is almost as shy as a
fox unless he is trailing some animal he
isn&#8217;t afraid of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he followed me,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it just wanted to see who you
were,&#8221; said the boy&#8217;s father. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the lynx would have jumped down on
you to scratch or bite you. It was just
curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the lumbermen said the same
thing, adding that not unless they were cornered
would a bobcat attack a man. So Ted
was really not in as much danger as he had
tried to think he was. Still it was scary
enough for the little chap.</p>

<p>Work at the lumber camp went on from
day to day. Dozens of great trees were
chopped down to be sawed up into boards.
Quite a pile of sawdust was mounting near
the mill now, and the children loved to play
in this. They would climb to a point near
the top of the pile. Then they would leap
into it near the bottom and they could not
get hurt because the sawdust was so soft.</p>

<p>However, it got into their shoes, so most
of the time they played in the sawdust bare-footed.
But it also got down inside their
clothes and scratched them; so that every
time they played in the sawdust pile they
had to go in and take off their clothes, shaking
them out to get rid of the ticklish, powdered
wood particles. Still they thought
this was part of the fun.</p>

<p>Once, when Trouble climbed to a higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
point for the jumping off place than he had
ever before been allowed to reach, and when
he had jumped into the sawdust, Ted and
Janet couldn&#8217;t find him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble! Trouble! Where are you?&#8221;
cried Janet, looking down the sawdust slope
for a sight of her small brother.</p>

<p>There was no answer and not a sign of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted!&#8221; called Janet. &#8220;Trouble&#8217;s
gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down in the sawdust!&#8221; Ted answered.
&#8220;He must have jumped into a hole
and he&#8217;s covered up. We&#8217;ll have to dig him
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not wait to call or run for help,
but, with their hands, began digging in
the soft and fluffy pile. In a few seconds
they had uncovered Trouble&#8217;s head. He
was all right, except that he was rather
badly frightened. As Teddy had explained,
Trouble had sunk down in a soft part of the
sawdust pile, and more of the dust sliding
down had covered him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, Trouble?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me &#8217;ike it,&#8221; he answered, with a laugh.
&#8220;I hab &#8217;ots ob fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Back he climbed to jump off again, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Ted would not let him leap from so great a
height.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t been here you might have
been buried in the sawdust all night,&#8221;
warned Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It be nice an&#8217; warm in there&mdash;nice as
my bed!&#8221; declared Trouble. And that is all
concerning the danger they could impress
on him.</p>

<p>The sawdust pile continued to be a place
of much fun for the Curlytops. Sometimes
they would start at the top and slide to the
bottom of the big heap, getting their curly
hair full of the dust, to the despair of their
mother and Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But chilluns suah hab got to play!&#8221;
chuckled the black maid, as she used the
brush.</p>

<p>And play the Curlytops did!</p>

<p>Mr. Martin did not want to spend too
much time in the woods, as his own store,
back at Cresco, needed attention. But there
was so much to do at Mount Major in order
to get the lumber store well started and the
men who were to be left in charge needed
so much advice that the father of the Curlytops
had to remain longer than at first he
had intended.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>However, Ted, Janet and Trouble did not
mind, as they thought there was no finer
place in all the world than the woods where
they were camping. And as the children
liked it and as it was doing them good to be
out in the woods and the fresh air, Mrs.
Martin was willing to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin had nothing to do with the
cutting of the trees and the floating of them
to the mill to be cut up into lumber. But
he owned some shares in the company, which
is the reason he took such an interest in the
store. He wanted to see it do well.</p>

<p>So the Curlytops remained in the woods,
and it began to look as though the whole
summer would be spent there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the best vacation we ever
had,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; agreed his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly the children never looked better,&#8221;
declared Mrs. Martin. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were so many things to watch in the
lumber business that the children never
found time hanging heavy on their hands if
they did not care to play. They could visit
the mill, watch great trees being chopped
down, they could see the men making up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
rafts in the river or the lake and they could
see the sawed boards being carted off to be
shipped on railroad trains.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like best to see the logs go down the
chute into the river,&#8221; said Ted to his sister,
when they were talking about the different
sights around camp. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go over there
now,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you won&#8217;t get lost?&#8221; asked
Janet. For it was in going to this chute before
that Ted wandered off and got lost in
the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know the way now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Curlytops started, but Trouble called
after them:</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ants to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we take him or hide?&#8221; asked Ted.
Often when they did not want William to
tag after them, the brother and sister would
hide. After Trouble had tearfully searched
for them, not finding them, he would go to
his mother to be comforted. In this way
Ted and Janet would find a chance to slip
off where they wanted to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s take him along&mdash;don&#8217;t hide
from him,&#8221; said Janet, who had a soft spot
in her heart for Trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;Come on then,&#8221; invited Ted.</p>

<p>Soon the three children were wandering
through the woods on the way to the lumber
chute. The path was plain now, being much
worn by constant use, and they could not
get lost. So their mother was not worried
about their trip, only warning them to be
careful of Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; promised Janet.</p>

<p>Well, of course she meant to be, and so
did Ted. But you never could tell what
Trouble would do.</p>

<p>When the children reached the place they
found that the men were away. The choppers
had gone farther back in the woods to
cut down more trees, having sent down the
chute all that were near it.</p>

<p>That is, all the logs had been sent down
but one, and this had stuck in the chute near
the top, being balanced like a teeter-totter,
or seesaw, on the very edge of the chute.</p>

<p>The log was perfectly balanced at the
middle, half of it hanging down the chute
and the other half extending over the end
where the men stood to start the logs on their
trip to the river, a hundred feet or more
below.</p>

<p>Before Ted or Janet could stop him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Trouble had climbed up on the chute and
had gotten astride the log. Then he found
that it moved up and down, like a seesaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble hab fine ride!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He wiggled himself until he actually had
the log moving up and down, with him on
it. A moment later the log might have become
unbalanced and have gone down the
chute, taking Trouble with it to the river
below. Ted saw the danger at once, and in
an instant sprang and pulled his little
brother from the log.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble, you shouldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want wide!&#8221; protested the little fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d have one ride too many if
you rolled down the chute into the river with
the log,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi there! Keep away from that chute!&#8221;
shouted some of the men, coming back just
then with teams that had hauled more logs
to be slid down. &#8220;Keep away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; Ted answered. &#8220;I was just taking
Trouble away!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, for his own good, so he would not
again do anything so dangerous, the men
scolded Trouble and made him cry. Then he
promised not to climb up on the chute again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>It was better to have Trouble crying unhurt
than to have him crying after an accident.
Ted and Janet knew this.</p>

<p>For a time they watched the men rolling
the logs into the chute and saw them go
pitching to the river far below. Then, having
had enough of this fun, the Curlytops
and Trouble wandered back through the
forest to the bungalow.</p>

<p>As they neared it they saw some clouds
of smoke floating over the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be running the sawmill engine extra
fast,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you smell something burning?&#8221;
asked Janet.</p>

<p>Ted sniffed the air and shook his head
to say that he smelled nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do!&#8221; cried Janet. She ran on a
little farther, and then she saw what it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ted! Ted!&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;The big
sawdust pile is on fire!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>TROUBLE HAS A RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment or two Teddy thought his
sister was &#8220;pretending,&#8221; as she often did,
or that she was &#8220;fooling&#8221; him. But she
seemed so much in earnest as he looked at
her that he could not but believe what she
said was true. Still he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, is it burning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cross my heart it is!&#8221; answered Janet,
this being the strongest way she had of letting
her brother know it was the truth she
was speaking. &#8220;The sawdust pile is truly
on fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>And a moment later Ted saw it for himself.
The big pile of fine, wooden dust
thrown off by the big buzz saw was blazing
and smoking, and running around it were
many of the lumbermen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I go get my fire engine!&#8221; cried
Trouble. He pulled his hand away from
Janet who was holding him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;No, you stay right with me!&#8221; she ordered,
running after him.</p>

<p>Trouble had a toy fire engine that sometimes
squirted real water out of a tiny hose
that was fast to it. I say &#8220;sometimes,&#8221; for
often the fire engine could not be found,
and, when found, it might not work because
Trouble had stuffed sand or something else
in the hose. But now his thought was of this
toy as he saw the burning sawdust pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put it out wif my engine,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep away,&#8221; advised Ted.
&#8220;This is going to be a bad fire,&#8221; and he took
hold of Trouble&#8217;s other hand to help Janet
hold the little fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it will be bad, Ted?&#8221; asked
Janet, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Look at the
smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great cloud of it now swirling
around the sawmill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think our bungalow will catch?&#8221;
Janet next wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess not,&#8221; said Ted hopefully.
&#8220;The wind isn&#8217;t blowing that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time his father&#8217;s store was burning
he had heard some of the firemen speak of
the wind, and Teddy remembered this now.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want our bungalow to burn,&#8221;
went on Janet. &#8220;If I thought it was I&#8217;d
get out my dolls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I want my fire engine!&#8221; wailed
Trouble. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it to burn up! Oh,
dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t burn,&#8221; Janet consoled him.
&#8220;Come, we&#8217;ll go home,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I see
mother calling us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was in the doorway of the
bungalow, beckoning to the children. When
the sawdust pile caught fire she had come to
see where they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in out of the way!&#8221; she called,
and they ran to her.</p>

<p>By this time a gang of the lumbermen
were starting to put out the fire. There was
a short length of hose from which a small
stream of water spurted, and, for a time,
Ted wondered where it came from, as he
knew there were no fire engines in the
woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it start, Mother?&#8221; asked Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;By sparks from the sawmill engine
smoke stack, I think,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it burn the store?&#8221; asked Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; his mother replied. &#8220;And
see, the men are pulling the sawdust pile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
apart to get the burning side away from
that which hasn&#8217;t yet started to burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lumbermen saw that this was the only
way to stop the fire from spreading. As yet
only one side of the sawdust pile was on
fire. Working on the side that was not yet
blazing, with shovels and long sticks, the
men were pulling the mass of fine, wooden
dust into two parts.</p>

<p>It was just as if you had set fire to one
side of a big pile of leaves, and then found
that you didn&#8217;t want to burn them all. If
you had no water to throw on the fire you
could, with a rake, pull off to one side in the
street those leaves that had not already
caught fire. Then you could let those that
had caught burn out.</p>

<p>That is what the lumbermen did. They
separated the sawdust pile in two parts,
with a space between them. There was a
little water to squirt on the blaze, but not
much. The small hose came from the water
tank with which the boiler of the sawmill
engine was filled, and this stream, with no
pump behind to force it out, only dribbled a
little way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste that water on the fire!&#8221;
cried Tod Everett.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we haven&#8217;t enough. Use the
hose to wet the ground between the two
piles, and then the fire won&#8217;t travel over.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was good advice, for the fire in the
blazing part of the sawdust was now so
strong that it would have taken a large
stream of water to put it out. But a little
water would answer to wet the space between
the two piles of dust, and this the foreman
wanted done.</p>

<p>His men heeded what he said, and soon
most of the danger was over. The larger
pile of clean sawdust had been pulled far
to one side so it would not catch, and the
remainder was allowed to burn itself out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I squirt with my engine just a
little bit?&#8221; begged Trouble, when he saw
that the excitement was dying out with the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; his mother told him.
&#8220;Fires are good places to stay away from
for little boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; to be a big boy. Daddy said
so,&#8221; pouted Trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you aren&#8217;t big enough, yet, to put
out fires,&#8221; his mother remarked, with a
laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>But a little later the fire was so nearly
out that she took the Curlytops and Trouble
close to see what damage had been done.
Aside from a few boards and the sawdust
that had been burned, the loss was small.
There was no loss in the sawdust, for it was
of no use. Some farmers living near by
used to come to get a load or two to fill their
ice houses, but the remainder was allowed
to rot in the forest.</p>

<p>After the fire was over Mr. Martin and
Tod Everett, the foreman, began asking how
it had started. No one had really seen the
first tiny blaze begin, but it was thought that
sparks from the smoke stack of the sawmill
must have started it. This seemed most
likely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you had better put a spark arrester
on that stack,&#8221; said Mr. Martin to the mill
foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; agreed Mr. Everett. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want any more blazes. The next time more
than sawdust might go up in smoke. I intended
to have a spark arrester on that stack
all along, but there has been so much to do,
starting this new camp, that I haven&#8217;t got
at it. But I surely will make a spark arrester
now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;Mother, how can they arrest sparks?&#8221;
Trouble asked in a whisper, as he heard this
talk. &#8220;Does they have a policeman to arrest
sparks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they do he&#8217;d have to travel in an airship!&#8221;
laughed Ted. &#8220;For the sparks are
always flying through the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Everett didn&#8217;t mean a policeman,
dear,&#8221; explained Mrs. Martin to Trouble.
&#8220;He means a spark arrester would stop the
sparks from flying from the stacks. Arrest
means to stop, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do they stop the sparks,&#8221; asked
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generally they put a piece of wire netting
over the top of the chimney or smokestack,&#8221;
his mother answered. &#8220;The smoke
can go through the netting, but the sparks
can&#8217;t. It is the big, red hot sparks, flying
from the stack, that do the damage. In
most locomotives there are these spark arresters
of iron or wire netting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw any,&#8221; Janet said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because they are set down inside
the locomotive smokestack,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>The next day the children watched men
fasten a heavy piece of wire netting over the
top of the sawmill smokestack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Of all the places about the lumber camp
where the Curlytops best liked to be, the
sawmill was their choice. They liked to
watch the big trees chopped or sawed down,
they were fond of lingering near the log
chute, and they delighted to see the men
build timber rafts on the river and float on
them.</p>

<p>But the sawmill they liked best of all.
There was a delightfully clean smell about
it&mdash;a smell of the woods as the logs were
cut into boards, the sawdust flying about in
a cloud. The saw, too, made such a funny
&#8220;zipping&#8221; sound. First there would be a
low hum, as the sharp teeth bit into the end
of the log. Then the sound would become
higher and shriller as the saw turned faster
and faster.</p>

<p>Finally there would sound a whine, like
that of some animal, and the saw would
come to the end of the log with a &#8220;zip,&#8221; and
then there would be only a low, pleasant
hum.</p>

<p>The saw was not the only piece of machinery
in the mill that moved. Another
piece was the &#8220;carriage,&#8221; on which the log
was carried toward the saw. This carriage
was a frame work on which the log rested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
as it went forward inch by inch and foot
by foot to be cut into board lengths. Besides
the carriage there was a log chain, winding
around a drum.</p>

<p>The logs were brought near the end of
the long incline up which they were first
hauled by this chain. On the end of the
chain was a great hook. This hook would
either be driven into the log by one of the
men pounding it with his axe, or the chain
would be wrapped about the log and the
hook caught in the chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull away!&#8221; the lumberman would call
to the engineer. The engineer would then
shove over a handle, the chain would begin
to wind itself up around the drum and the
log would be hauled up to the saw carriage.</p>

<p>Other men would take off the chain and
roll the log in place, fastening it on the
carriage so it would not slip.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready!&#8221; they would call, and the
engineer would pull another handle which
would start the carriage, carrying the log,
end on, toward the big buzz saw.</p>

<p>At certain times, when she could be with
them, the Curlytops and Trouble were taken
by their mother to the sawmill. And when
there was a long log on the carriage, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
starting to be cut up, she would let them sit
down on the far end of the traveling frame
and &#8220;ride.&#8221; This was the greatest fun of
all.</p>

<p>It was almost as good as being an engineer
of the mill, Ted used to think. As for Janet,
she pretended the slow-moving log and the
carriage on which it rested was a chariot
drawn by big elephants going through the
jungle.</p>

<p>As for Trouble, he liked to pretend that
the sawmill carriage and log was his
&#8220;horsie,&#8221; and he sat astride the log and
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-dap! Gid-dap!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, without anyone knowing it, Trouble
had watched the engineer of the mill pull
the handles that started the machinery until
the little fellow, who was very smart, felt
sure he could do it himself. He only wanted
the chance, and he knew he must be alone,
for he felt sure his mother would not let
him go there if she saw him.</p>

<p>So, watching his opportunity, Trouble
one day stole away to the sawmill. As it
happened, the machinery was not running,
though the power needed but to be turned
on, and none of the men was in the place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
It was Trouble&#8217;s chance. He had the whole
mill to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get a wide,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>He toddled to the handle he had so often
seen the engineer pull when he wanted to
start the saw to buzzing and the carriage
to rolling along. There was a big log already
in place.</p>

<p>Trouble pulled. At first nothing happened.
He pulled again, harder than before.
There was a hissing sound, a low
rumble, and the saw began slowly to revolve.
Then the carriage started gently forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do it!&#8221; cried Trouble in delight. &#8220;Now
I get a wide!&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran to the far end of the log and carriage
and sat down, pretending that he was
astride his &#8220;horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble was having a ride! But it was a
dangerous ride!</p>

<small>THE CURLYTOPS ADRIFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucky</span> it was for Trouble that Tod Everett,
the foreman, caught the sound of the
moving machinery&mdash;the creaking of the log
carriage and the buzz of the big saw that
was beginning to whine as if hungry to bite
into the log on which the little boy was
riding.</p>

<p>And as soon as Tod heard the sound of
the machinery he knew something was
wrong. One reason was because it was not
yet time to start. Another reason was that
the engineer of the mill was standing right
beside him, talking about a new lot of logs
that had been floated down the river that
day.</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another as the
sound came to their ears, and the foreman
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s running the mill for you, Zeb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody,&#8221; answered Zeb White, the engineer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
&#8220;She isn&#8217;t supposed to be runnin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she <i>is</i> running!&#8221; declared Tod.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right!&#8221; cried the engineer.
&#8220;But who could have started her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word the two men ran
up the little hill, for they were at the bottom
of it and away from the mill, and could
not look into the place. But when they
reached the top they could hear the rattle
of the moving carriage more plainly. They
could hear the whine and hum of the big
saw.</p>

<p>And then they saw Trouble calmly sitting
astride the log, playing it was his horse, and,
all the while, drawing nearer and nearer to
the sharp-toothed saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled the foreman. &#8220;That
kid is in mischief again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you reckon he started my engine?&#8221;
cried Zeb.</p>

<p>Tod Everett did not answer. He sprang
to catch Trouble off the log, pulling him to
one side rather roughly in his strong arms.
At the same time the engineer ran for the
handle that shut off the power. He pulled
it quickly, with all his strength, and the saw
slowly ceased buzzing, while the log on the
carriage no longer moved forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;Say, you little tyke!&#8221; cried Tod, for he
was angry, &#8220;did you start the machinery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did start it,&#8221; answered Trouble,
hardly knowing whether to laugh or cry.
&#8220;What for you take me off my horsie?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horsie? Say, you don&#8217;t want to ride
this dangerous kind of horse again!&#8221; cried
the engineer. &#8220;That big saw might have
cut you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He, too, spoke sternly, and Trouble decided
that all fun had gone out of the world.
He began to cry. He cried hard, too.</p>

<p>By this time his mother, who had missed
him, had come out in search of him. It took
her only a few moments to understand what
had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble, you are a naughty boy!&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not naughty!&#8221; he sobbed. &#8220;I wanted
a wide&mdash;a wide on my saw horsie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you were bad,&#8221; went on his mother,
with a grave face. &#8220;I told you never to
come to the mill alone, and you didn&#8217;t mind.
I told you never to touch a handle or anything,
and you didn&#8217;t mind. You are a bad
boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Trouble sobbed again, looked from one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the other of the three stern faces in a circle
about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;yes, I&mdash;I <i>is</i> a bad boy!&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must be whipped,&#8221; his mother
told him.</p>

<p>I wish I did not have to write about this
part of it, but I have undertaken to tell
you all about the Curlytops and Trouble,
and I must put in the bad with the good.</p>

<p>Trouble was whipped, and he cried hard.
But this was better than crying after being
hurt by the saw, as might have happened.
And the whipping was the best way in the
world to make Trouble remember never
again to go near the machinery alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that he never does such a thing
again,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll never leave the mill alone again,
with the power ready to be turned on,&#8221; said
the engineer.</p>

<p>So it all ended more happily than it might
have, if the machinery had not been stopped
in time. And though the Curlytops felt sorry
for their little brother, it was not as bad
as it might have been, for which they were
very thankful.</p>

<p>As a further punishment, and to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
him remember not to do such a thing again,
Trouble was not allowed to go with Teddy
and Janet the next time they had a picnic
in the woods.</p>

<p>They were always having picnics&mdash;sometimes
two in one day. But they enjoyed the
tramps in the forest and they had no end
of fun eating the lunches they begged from
their father in the camp store.</p>

<p>This time they went on a picnic the day
after Trouble had had his &#8220;wide,&#8221; as he
called it, on the saw carriage. That is Ted
and Janet went, and William remained at
home. He wanted to go, very much, but his
mother was firm, and though the Curlytops
felt sad to hear their little brother cry to
come with them, they were old enough to
know it was for his own good that he must
stay at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; asked Ted, as he and
his sister walked through the forest. Ted
very often left it to Janet to suggest some
form of fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look for the tame crow,&#8221; proposed
the little girl. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to find him and
take him back to Mr. Jenk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;We&#8217;d get a
lot of money then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;And the crow is in these woods,&#8221; went
on Janet. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we saw him that time
the woodpecker was tapping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow all right,&#8221;
said her brother. &#8220;But how can we catch
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet thought for a minute. Then she
remembered something that had happened
back home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Cheese!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheese? What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember how fond the Jim
crow was of cheese?&#8221; went on Janet.
&#8220;Whenever he used to get away Mr. Jenk
would go after him, calling and holding out
a bit of cheese. And Jim would fly down to
get the cheese and Mr. Jenk would catch
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; cried Teddy. &#8220;And then he&#8217;d
make believe pull corks. I mean the crow
would,&#8221; he added, though Janet understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to daddy&#8217;s store and get
some cheese,&#8221; proposed Janet. She called
it &#8220;daddy&#8217;s store,&#8221; though Mr. Martin did
not own it and had only been engaged to
start it going. But the children always
thought of the camp store as they did of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the one in Cresco, as belonging to their
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll make a cheese trap,&#8221; agreed
Ted.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin was not in the store when they
trudged back, but one of the clerks gave
them what they wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t eat too much cheese,&#8221; he warned
them. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t good for Curlytops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh we&#8217;re not going to eat it,&#8221; said Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for the lame, tame crow,&#8221; added
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world are those kiddies up
to now, I wonder,&#8221; said one clerk to another.
&#8220;Talking about a lame, tame crow, and
taking him out some cheese!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; chuckled his companion.
&#8220;They do more things in a day than I could
think of in a week. And that small chap&mdash;the
one they call Trouble&mdash;say, he&#8217;s a <i>tyke</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly is. Well, I only hope they
won&#8217;t get sick eating the cheese, and have
Mr. Martin blame me for giving it to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Ted and Janet had no idea of
eating the cheese, though they liked a little
nibble now and then. But this cheese was
for the lame, tame crow they were sure they
had seen in the woods. They were quite certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
it was Mr. Jenk&#8217;s black pet and they
hoped to get the ten dollars reward.</p>

<p>But the woods at Mount Major and
around their camp were wide and long, and
though the children did not know it, hunting
for a certain crow in them was like looking
for a needle in the haystack.</p>

<p>On and on through the woods tramped the
Curlytops. It was a pleasant day and it was
early, for they had set off on their picnic
soon after dinner. They had with them
some lunch for themselves and the cheese
for the crow&mdash;if they should happen to find
Jim.</p>

<p>Every now and then they would stop and
listen, and often they heard the distant cawing
of crows. But this was what happened
every day in the woods. There were many
crows.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they all sound alike when they
caw,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but Jim crow can pop corks, and no
other crow can do that,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;And
he can stand on one leg in such a funny
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted her brother, &#8220;if we hear
a cork popping we&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they heard nothing like this as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
wandered on through the woods. Sometimes
they even caught glimpses of crows
flying overhead, but these black birds did
not come down low enough to see the pieces
of cheese which the Curlytops held out to
them, hoping that one of the crows might
be Mr. Jenk&#8217;s Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Janet after a while.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll never find that crow. It&#8217;s
like mother&#8217;s diamond locket that I lost. I
guess it&#8217;s gone forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the locket is,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ve seen the crow, so we know he&#8217;s somewhere
around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where?&#8221; asked his sister.</p>

<p>And Ted could not answer.</p>

<p>Still they did not give up. They had come
to the woods to spend the afternoon. They
could eat about three o&#8217;clock when they
usually got hungry, and they might as well
hunt for Jim as do anything else or play any
of their pretend games.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; said Janet, after a bit.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down and rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And eat,&#8221; added Teddy. He was nearly
always ready to do the latter.</p>

<p>So the children sat down on a mossy log
in the pleasant shade of the forest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
opened the little boxes of lunch they had
obtained in the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we eat we&#8217;ll spread out some of
the cheese,&#8221; said Janet. &#8220;Maybe Jim will
smell it and fly down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy thought this would be all right, so
they put some bits of cheese on a flat stump
not far from where they sat down to eat
their own lunch.</p>

<p>As they ate they kept an anxious watch,
and also listened closely for any sound of
cawing in the air overhead. But, for some
reason or other, the crows, perhaps Jim with
them, had flown away for the time being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess there&#8217;s no crow here,&#8221; said
Janet after a while, as she stood up and
brushed the crumbs from her lap. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ted. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
leave some of the cheese here, and when we
come back we&#8217;ll look again for Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe if we tapped on a tree like the
woodpecker did, Jim would hear it and come
to us,&#8221; suggested Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; her brother said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With sticks the children tapped on trees,
making a noise as nearly like the sound of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
woodpecker as they could manage. But this
brought to them no tame crow, and, indeed,
no wild one, either.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go on,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>Part of the cheese was left on the flat
stump where they had spread it as bait.
The remainder they picked up and took with
them farther into the woods. They were
having fun, even if they didn&#8217;t find the
lame, tame crow.</p>

<p>After a little while the Curlytops came
to an open place in the forest. Across it
they saw water gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s the lake!&#8221; cried Ted. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know it came up this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lake was of odd shape, and parts of
it, like the arms of an octopus, stretched
out into different parts of the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in wading!&#8221; cried Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I!&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>They took off their shoes and stockings
and splashed about in the clean, warm water
of the lake near shore. Then Ted discovered
a boat hidden in the bushes on shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s have a ride!&#8221; he called to Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any oars,&#8221; she objected, as
Ted pulled the boat out so he could get in.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
poles and push ourselves around. Come on,
I&#8217;ll be captain! We&#8217;ll have lots of fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Janet was always ready for fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must take our shoes and stockings,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;If we leave &#8217;em here somebody
might steal &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll take &#8217;em in the boat, and the
lunch, too,&#8221; her brother agreed.</p>

<p>They quickly put their things in the old
scow, for that is all the boat was, and then,
having found some poles in the woods, the
Curlytops pushed out from shore.</p>

<p>Soon they were adrift, moving slowly
along the beach, first Ted and then Janet
pushing with their poles to keep the boat
moving. It was warm and pleasant out on
the lake, and the Curlytops thought they
were having fine fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out a little farther,&#8221; proposed
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; confessed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we can easily pole ourselves back,&#8221;
said Ted.</p>

<p>So they went out a little farther. They
were more than a hundred feet from shore
when Janet suddenly gave a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; called Ted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;I lost my push-pole!&#8221; his sister answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it for you,&#8221; Ted offered.</p>

<p>He pushed the boat toward his sister&#8217;s
floating pole, but, in doing so, lost hold of
his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now mine&#8217;s gone!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Then the wind suddenly blew, sending the
boat farther away from the two poles. They
now had no means of moving the boat unless
they paddled with their hands. Ted tried
this, but could not make the craft come any
nearer the drifting poles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how far out we are from shore!&#8221;
cried Janet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back, Ted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted tried, but it was of no use. The wind
was blowing them farther and farther out
into the lake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>THE CROW&#8217;S NEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Curlytops were frightened at first
when they found that they were adrift in the
old boat with neither oars nor poles with
which to guide themselves back to shore.
But after the first fright Ted laughed and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on a voyage; we have something
to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far&#8217;ll we go?&#8221; asked Janet, still a
bit alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, across to the other shore,&#8221; and Ted
pointed to the other side of the lake. It was
about half a mile away, though once on that
shore the children might not have been able
to find a path back. For the shore of the
lake went winding in and out like the edges
of a blot of ink when you splatter a drop on
a sheet of paper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;I wish we could get the poles,&#8221; murmured
Janet. &#8220;Then we could push ourselves
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try again,&#8221; offered Teddy, and he
began paddling hard with his hands over the
side of the boat, endeavoring to send the
craft back to where the two poles could be
seen floating.</p>

<p>But as Teddy paddled with his hands only
on one side of the boat, it was just the same
as if he had rowed with one oar. The scow
began to go around in a circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a merry-go-round!&#8221; chuckled
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t do it!&#8221; complained
Janet. &#8220;It makes me dizzy to go around like
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you paddle on your side then,&#8221;
suggested Ted. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we have to do&mdash;paddle
on both sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true; just as when you want a
boat to go straight you must row with two
oars, one on each side, and you must pull
evenly on each oar.</p>

<p>Putting her shoes and stockings with
Ted&#8217;s, up in the bow of the boat, Janet began
paddling with her hands on one side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
while her brother paddled on the other side.
In this way they managed to send the boat
back a little way, even though the wind was
blowing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting nearer to the poles,&#8221; cried
Teddy. &#8220;I think I can reach one now. Stop
paddling, Janet!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and Teddy leaned over the
side of the boat. He stretched his hands
out as far as he could reach, but as soon
as the paddling stopped the boat began to
drift back again, blown by the wind. Wider
and wider became the space between Ted&#8217;s
outstretched hands and the floating poles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;You&#8217;ll fall
over!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ted came very nearly doing this.
Just in time he leaned back and sat down in
the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get those poles!&#8221; sighed Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can!&#8221; declared Teddy. He was
not a boy to give up easily. He started
paddling with his hands again, as did Janet.
Once more they were almost within reach
of the poles, but the wind blew them back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Teddy had to
admit, rather out of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s drift over to the other shore, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
then we can get out of the boat and walk
home,&#8221; suggested Janet.</p>

<p>This seemed the best plan to follow. So
the Curlytops sat in the boat and tried to
pretend that they were enjoying the voyage
and having a good time. But, to tell you the
truth, they were rather worried and frightened.</p>

<p>The wind was now blowing stronger, but
the children saw that this would, all the
more quickly, send them to the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat!&#8221; suggested Ted, after a bit.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make believe we&#8217;re shipwrecked
sailors and we&#8217;ll eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t eat the cheese,&#8221; objected
Janet. &#8220;We might find Jim the crow on the
other shore, and we could catch him with
some cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Teddy. He was not
very fond of cheese anyhow, and he was
willing that Jim should have it&mdash;if they
could find Jim.</p>

<p>They were more than half way across the
little bay, or arm of the lake, and they could
see that the other shore was a sandy one on
which to land when, from the woods they
had left, came a shout.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Where you children going with that
boat?&#8221; hailed a man.</p>

<p>Looking back Janet and Ted saw a
stranger standing on the shore near the
place where they had dragged out the craft
which had been hidden under the bushes.
The man had a pair of oars in his hand,
and it was evident that he had come to use
his boat. He had probably taken the oars
back home with him, knowing that the boat
could not be taken far without them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going with my boat?&#8221; he
asked, rather angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t mean to take it away,&#8221; Ted
called back. The talk could plainly be heard,
as voices carry well over water, you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you take it away for?&#8221;
asked the man, who was a stranger to the
Curlytops. &#8220;That&#8217;s my boat. I want to go
fishing in it and now you have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d bring it back if we could,&#8221; Teddy
called back. &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry. We only went
out a little way but we lost our poles and we
can&#8217;t get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stood there and seemed to be
thinking for a moment. Then he laughed
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sit quiet and don&#8217;t fall out. You&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
be at the other shore soon. Land there and
make the boat fast. I&#8217;ll walk around and
row you back. Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Curlytops felt better after this. They
watched the man turn back with his oars
over his shoulder. He was soon lost to sight
in the bushes. Then Ted and Janet looked
toward the other shore which was coming
nearer and nearer. Of course they were
really coming nearer to the shore, for the
land did not move. But in the boat it looked
as though it did.</p>

<p>The wind blew in puffs, and when one
stronger than those before it struck the
boat it blew it well up on the sandy beach.
Ted jumped out and pulled the boat farther
up on shore, while Janet remained in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can get out,&#8221; Ted told her.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay here until the man walks around
and rows us back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a good man, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; asked
Janet, as she handed Ted his shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t very cross
&#8217;cause we took his boat. I didn&#8217;t know it
was anybody&#8217;s&mdash;hid like that in the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, either,&#8221; agreed Janet, as she
and her brother put on their shoes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>There was nothing to do until the man
came, for the Curlytops were on a strange
shore and did not want to wander away
and get lost. So they sat down on stones,
near where Ted had tied the boat to keep
it from drifting away, and they ate what
little lunch remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I do with this cheese?&#8221; asked
Ted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose we&#8217;re going to find
any crows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Janet slowly. &#8220;But maybe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly, for in the air
overhead sounded a loud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; whispered Janet.</p>

<p>Fluttering down from the sky was a big,
black bird. It flew to a low stump of a tree,
not far from where the children sat, and
there the crow perched, still cawing.</p>

<p>In wonder and hope the children watched
the crow. The bird turned its head from
side to side, and seemed to be looking about
for any danger. He appeared to see the
Curlytops, but did not mind them.</p>

<p>Then the crow began moving about on the
edge of the stump, stirring up something
down in the hollow of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Oh, Ted!&#8221; cried Janet. &#8220;I believe that
crow has a nest in the stump!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does look so,&#8221; admitted her brother.</p>

<p>As the two children saw the crow stepping
about Janet observed something else. Eagerly
she clutched Ted&#8217;s arm and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ted, that crow is lame, just like Mr.
Jenk&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s tame, too,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;He
isn&#8217;t a bit afraid of us. I&#8217;m going to offer
him some cheese!&#8221; He held out a bit in his
hand to the black bird. &#8220;Here, Jim! Jim!&#8221;
coaxed Teddy. &#8220;Here&#8217;s cheese for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw!&#8221; croaked the glossy bird,
head on one side. It fluttered its wings and
seemed about to fly toward Teddy to get the
cheese.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted! I&#8217;m going to tap like a woodpecker!&#8221;
said Janet. &#8220;And you snap your
fingers. If that&#8217;s Jim, the lame, tame crow,
he&#8217;ll stand on one leg and he&#8217;ll pull a cork!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>Janet tapped on a tree near her, using a
stick to make the sound. Teddy snapped
his fingers as well as he was able. Instantly
the crow stopped cawing. It turned its head
on one side and then, a moment later, stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
on one leg, thrusting the other&mdash;the lame
one&mdash;out from him like a stiff stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Teddy! Look!&#8221; whispered Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snap! Snap!&#8221; went Teddy&#8217;s chubby
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop! Pop!&#8221; exploded the crow, like a
cork coming from a bottle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Jim! It&#8217;s Mr. Jenk&#8217;s lame,
tame crow, Jim! We&#8217;ve found him!&#8221;
shouted Janet in delight. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with another hoarse caw, the crow
flew over and began picking at the cheese
in Teddy&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it, they had found
the lame crow. Jim was so tame, and he
knew the Curlytops so well, that he allowed
his black feathers to be stroked as he picked
at the cheese. He seemed to be enjoying
himself very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ve got him how are we going
to keep him?&#8221; asked Ted. &#8220;He may fly
away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could tie a string to his leg,&#8221; suggested
Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; decided her brother. He had
plenty of string in his pocket. Putting the
cheese down on a log, where Jim could pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
at it, Ted soon tied a strong cord around the
crow&#8217;s sound leg. The other end of the cord
Ted fastened to his waist to have both his
hands free.</p>

<p>While he was doing this Janet walked
over to the low stump where the crow had
what might be called his nest, though wild
crows always build in the highest trees they
can find. Janet looked down in the hollow
stump. She saw bits of mussel shells, some
bright pebbles, a lot of hair from the tails
of horses and a shiny piece of tin. Then
she saw something else that caused her to
cry out in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Teddy, who had tied
Jim fast to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look what I&#8217;ve found!&#8221; gasped
Janet. She held up something glittering
and shiny that dangled to and fro. &#8220;It&#8217;s
mother&#8217;s diamond locket and chain that
we were playing house with!&#8221; cried Janet.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve found mother&#8217;s lost locket in Jim
crow&#8217;s nest! Oh, how glad I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I!&#8221; said Teddy, rejoicing with
his sister. &#8220;But how did it get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim must have flown over to our house
and picked it up off the box when we ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
out to see the auto accident,&#8221; answered
Janet.</p>

<p>And that is exactly how it had happened.
Of course Jim could not talk and tell about
it, for he could only pull corks and whistle.
But from what is known of crows&mdash;how
fond they are of bright things&mdash;it could
easily be guessed what had happened.</p>

<p>Jim, flying away from Mr. Jenk&#8217;s house,
had seen the glittering locket where Janet
had left it for a moment as she and her
brothers hurried out to the street. The crow
had picked it up and had flown off to the
woods with it, as they often do with bright
and shining things that take their fancy.</p>

<p>Being a tame crow, Jim had made his
nest in a low stump instead of a high tree,
and there he had dropped the diamond
locket, having really no further use for it.
And there it had been all this while. Jim
must have liked his new freedom, for he
did not fly back to Mr. Jenk&#8217;s house, though
very likely the lame crow the children once
saw was this same Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, everything is coming out all right!&#8221;
happily cried Janet, as she looked at the
diamond ornament. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
locket that I thought I&#8217;d lost, and we have
Mr. Jenk&#8217;s crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get ten dollars, too,&#8221; laughed Ted.</p>

<p>The man who owned the boat came. He
was surprised when he heard the children&#8217;s
story, and said he often had known crows
to fly away with bright things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have three passengers to row
back, instead of two,&#8221; he said, with a laugh.
&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221; he asked the Curlytops.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Mount Major, near the sawmill,&#8221;
they told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where it is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon
have you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later when he rowed up to the
bungalow dock he found Mr. and Mrs. Martin
just beginning to get worried about Ted
and Janet.</p>

<p>You can imagine how surprised everyone
was when the Curlytops came back, not only
with the missing crow but also the diamond
locket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw such lucky children!&#8221;
chuckled Tod Everett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caw! Caw!&#8221; croaked the crow, as if of
the same opinion. Jim did not try to get
away. He seemed to have had enough of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
freedom. But no chances were taken and
he was kept fastened by a string until he
could be sent back to Mr. Jenk.</p>

<p>True to his promise, the owner of the
lame, tame crow paid the ten dollar reward
to Teddy and Janet. Part of the money was
given them to spend, and the remainder was
put in the bank for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly had a fine summer in
the woods,&#8221; said Mr. Martin, when the time
came to go back, for he had the camp store
in good running order now.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the best time we ever had!&#8221;
agreed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was exciting, too,&#8221; added Janet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I have my little diamond locket
back,&#8221; said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I glad I got a new fire engine, an&#8217; it
squirts weal water!&#8221; laughed Trouble, for
Ted and Janet had taken part of their reward
money and bought him a new toy.</p>

<p>So all ended happily. But this is not the
end of the adventures of the Curlytops, for
there are more to follow. But, for a while,
we will bid them good-bye.</p>

<p><i>This new series of girls&#8217; books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in knowing
the girls and seeing them solve the problems
that develop their character. Incidentally, a
great deal of historical information is imparted,
and a fine atmosphere of responsibility is made
pleasing and useful to the reader.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE
<i>or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</i></p>

<p>How the Linger-Not girls met and formed their club seems commonplace,
but this writer makes it fascinating, and how they made
their club serve a great purpose continues the interest to the end, and
introduces a new type of girlhood.</p>


<p>2. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE VALLEY FEUD
<i>or The Great West Point Chain</i></p>

<p>The Linger-Not girls had no thought of becoming mixed up with
feuds or mysteries, but their habit of being useful soon entangled
them in some surprising adventures that turned out happily for all,
and made the valley better because of their visit.</p>


<p>3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST
<i>or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</i></p>

<p>For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold-rush, seems unnatural until the
reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of their
friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms a fine
story.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
